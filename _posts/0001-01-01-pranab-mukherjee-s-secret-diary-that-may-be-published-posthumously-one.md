Soon after stepping down as the President of India, Pranab Mukherjee changed his Twitter handle to @citizenmukherjee, as a reminder that as a President he was merely the first citizen and after his tenure ended, he becomes a citizen of India like everyone else. However, few Indian citizens have lived a life that Mukherjee has.  <br>#PranabMukherjee #RIPPranabDa #OmShanti
