&quot;First of all, when buying a designer piece it has to go with everything else in my wardrobe,&quot; photographer Shaira Luna quips. Unlike most people, the lens woman, who's also fashion girl with a very distinct personal style, doesn't really look at the price tag when purchasing designer items. For Shaira, it's more about the story of each piece and how it can elevate her overall look. That said, it comes as no surprise that her all-time favorite pieces were not bought in the actual Gucci or Prada store, but collected from vintage stores and ukay-ukays from all over the globe. Making each purchase one-of-akind and even more special than any limited edition release.  <br>In this unique episode of Designer Favorites, Shaira shares her best designer finds that she probably hasn't posted on her style account @shairaluna.wardrobe on Instagram. Including a jaw-dropping five peso top you need to see to believe. Watch the video below to find out more:
