Freshly squeezed sugar cane juice is sold from street stands in Bangkok for just $0.60.  <br>The undiluted drink - which costs as much as $3 in the U.S. and Australia when mixed with ice - is a popular refreshment around Thailand.  <br>Footage shows how street vendors use portable machines with a rolling press to squeeze the juice from the long pieces of sugar cane.   <br>The liquid collects in the tank and is then filtered out into bottles and served to customers for 20 baht, around 60 cents.  <br>One Australian tourist said online that he loves to drink sugarcane juice ''mixed with some lime or lemon to balance the sweetness''.  <br>''in Sydney you'd pay at least $3 and 60 per cent of it would be ice,'' he added.  <br>Commenting on popular YouTube videos of the sugarcane juice machines in Bangkok, another viewer said: ''Fresh sugar cane juice is amazing. Even more delicious when mixed with lime juice.''  <br>Sugarcane is grown commercially in Southeast Asia, the Indian Subcontinent, North Africa, and Latin America, where the climate is most suitable.
