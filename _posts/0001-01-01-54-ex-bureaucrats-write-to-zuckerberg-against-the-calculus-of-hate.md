A group of 54 former bureaucrats have written to Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg to perform a serious audit of the implementation of the social media companyâ€™s hate-speech policy in India. The controversy was spotlighted by the Wall Street Journal earlier this month in a report that said Facebook India intervened in content moderation processes to ensure hate speeches by a Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader were not taken down.Congress leaders including Rahul Gandhi have also demanded an enquiry in the whole issue.  <br>#BJP #MarkZuckerberg #Congress #Facebook #RahulGandhi
