All new for 2020, the 2021 Soul enters this model year as a carryover with only minor enhancements. The Soul GT-Line Turbo is simplified to Soul Turbo this year, which is inclusive of revised badging on the grille, steering wheel and rear lift gate. Remote start, previously only available as part of the UVO telematics system, is now also integrated on the key fob for EX and Turbo models. Rear Occupant Alert (door-logic type) is now standard across all variants. The X-Line and GT-Line 2.0-liter models with 18-inch wheels add standard RS valves to the shock absorbers for improved ride comfort.
