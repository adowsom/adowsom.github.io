Thousands of Belarusians gathered outside the offices of the state TV channel in Minsk on Saturday (August 15th) to demand full coverage of the protests against the disputed presidential election.   <br>Opposition supporters outside the building in Minsk held banners with signs reading &quot;show people the truth.&quot;  <br>On election day, Belarusian state channels aired the voices of Lukashenko supporters and did not cover the demonstrations.   <br>State TV later showed footage of violence to blame protesters and warn people not to participate.  <br>Several journalists have resigned over the coverage.
