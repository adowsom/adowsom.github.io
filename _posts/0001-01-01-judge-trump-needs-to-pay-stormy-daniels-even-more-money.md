After already having paid her $130,000 in hush money, it's time for President Donald Trump to pay adult film actress Stormy Daniels once again.  <br>CNN reports a California Superior Court judge has ordered Trump to pay $44,100 to adult film actress Stephanie Clifford, to reimburse her attorneys' fees.  <br>CNN reports the judge's order was issued Monday and was posted online Friday by Clifford's attorneys. Clifford's stage name is Stormy Daniels.  <br>Judge Robert Broadbelt III ruled that Clifford was entitled to legal fees, finding her the 'prevailing party' under California law, despite the case having been dismissed.  <br>Clifford says she had an affair with Trump from 2006 to 2007 and signed a $130,000 nondisclosure agreement with former Trump attorney Michael Cohen.  <br>Cohen represented a shell company and a 'David Dennison,' which Clifford contends is a pseudonym for Trump. Trump denies the affair occurred.
