Cam Newton Steals the Show in Day 4 of Patriots Practice | Training Camp Central  <br>Bill Belichick said he expects one of the New England Patriots' quarterbacks to emerge at No. 1 and Cam Newton made a great case for himself on Thursday. Not only did Newton get more reps than Jarrett Stidham, he showed off his mobility and arm strength. The former NFL MVP also proved to be a threat on the goal line and has only thrown two interceptions compared to Stidham's seven.  <br>Evan Lazar tells Sierra Goodwill what impressed him about Newton and what's contributing to Stidham's struggles.
