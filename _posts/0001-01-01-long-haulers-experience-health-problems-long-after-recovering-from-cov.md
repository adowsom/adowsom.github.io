People known as 'long-haulers,' are those living with lingering COVID-19 symptoms. Considered to be medically recovered, they're still not well.  <br>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says many patients still have symptoms for up to five months after theyâ€™re considered recovered.  <br>Most commonly, long-haulers continue to have shortness of breath, a cough, and chest tightness--especially patients who were ventilated.  <br>Crashing fatigue is another common challenge, as are brain fog, memory problems, and hearing problems.  <br>Finally, heart problems in various forms can also be experienced, due to the trauma inflicted on the organ by the COVID-19 virus.
