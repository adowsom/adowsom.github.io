Meanwhile, Commander Dragos, a disgraced Byzantine warrior seeks to conquer Sogut. He kills Umur Bey and frames Gunduz Alp, pitting two tribes against each other.  <br>Emir Bahattin's presence serves to disrupt Ertugrul's plans against the Mongols. Following Gunduz's acquittal after the truth about Dragos is revealed, Beybolat Bey arrives. As the son of Umur Bey and Bey of the Umuroglu after his father's death he is a Seljuk assassin that works with the Mongols to wipe out rebelling Oguz Tribes, under a fake name Albasti.
