According to Ladbrokes, Meghan Markle is 100 - 1 to be running for president of the US in 2024, ranking higher than Michelle Obama or George Clooney.  <br>Meghan has been rallying women to vote in the upcoming presidential election in recent weeks. Members of the royal family are traditionally politically neutral, but Meghan's interest in politics has sparked the question as to whether she herself could ever run for president?   <br>According to constitutional experts, Meghan is well within her rights to run for president and hits all the required criteria. The royal family would not be in a position to stop Meghan, but nor could they support her either. Being a non-US citizen, Prince Harry would not even be able to vote for his wife.
