Separate teams of the Central Bureau of Investigation are questioning all the accused in the case of Sushant Singh Rajput's death. These include Rhea Chakraborty, Showik Chakraborty, Keshav Bachner, Dipesh Sawant, Rajat Mewati, Sandeep Shridhar, Samuel Miranda, Neeraj Singh and Siddharth Pithani.    <br>CBI is also likely to confront Rhea infront of Sushant Singh's house manager.    <br>Probing the money laundering angle in the case, the Enforcement Directorate revealed that it has cloned two mobile phones of Rhea Chakraborty and are also probing her digital data.    <br>Earlier, Rhea Chakraborty has been questioned by the ED twice in a money laundering case related to the death of actor Sushant Singh Rajput but has failed to answer questions asked by the team on her finances.
