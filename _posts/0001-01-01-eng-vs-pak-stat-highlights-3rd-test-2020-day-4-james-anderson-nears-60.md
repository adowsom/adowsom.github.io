Day 4 of the third test match between England and Pakistan at the Rose Bowl Cricket Ground brought in good news for James Anderson as he was just one wicket away from reaching the 600 wicket mark. On day three Pakistan got bundled out on 273 and then James Anderson once again sprang into action scalping one wicket. But the play was called off due to rains and at the end of the day, the scoreboard read 100/2 in 56 overs.  <br>#ENGvsPAK #MatchHighlights  <br>Link:   <br>Subscribe:     <br>Facebook:     <br>Twitter:          <br>Instagram:
