One person was killed after tourists flew down a glass slide too fast in the heavy rain and smashed into each other in northern China.  <br>The aftermath video, filmed in the city of Benxi in Liaoning Province on August 19, shows dozens of injured tourists at the bottom of the slide at Hugu Valley.  <br>The heavy rain caused the tourists to lose control on the 3,230-foot glass-bottomed slide and crash into each other at the bottom.  <br>After around half an hour, the rescuers arrived and injured tourists were sent to hospital.  <br>The case is in further investigation, reports said.
