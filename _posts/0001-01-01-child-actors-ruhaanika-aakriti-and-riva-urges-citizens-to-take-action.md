Child actor Ruhaanika Dhawan says it is very important for everyone to have clean water and a green environment, and that is why she always urges her friends to take action against climate change. Talking about the issue, Ye Hai Mohabbatein star Ruhaanika said, “It is very important for everyone to have clean water and a green environment. Mother Nature has been so kind to us in so many ways and now it is our turn to give it back. I have been urging my friends to come forward and opt for ways to take action against climate change.” Meanwhile URI actor Riva Arora feels “we are being told about global warming in school and the thought is very scary. Which is why I have been encouraging my friends and family to take small steps to protect nature like using cloth bags instead of plastic, and turning off the tap when not using, among other things.” Kullfi Kumarr Bajewala child star Aakriti Sharma added, “People across the world don’t realise how serious climate change really is and they take it very lightly. Now, that we learn about it in schools and also witness it when we see trees catching up fire due to global warming and the water level in oceans are increasing with every passing day; it’s becoming scarier and an issue to be spoken about.”
