Maggie, the Red Irish Setter, wanted to sit in her favourite spot on the couch. However, Gracie, the Golden Retriever puppy, was already lying there. Maggie hopped on the couch and sat right on top of Gracie, who could not understand what happened. She wiggled out from underneath and sat on the far end of the couch.
