There were suggestions for political parties aligned to Warisan to contest using the Warisan logo in the upcoming Sabah state elections, however that won’t be the case for PKR, party president Anwar Ibrahim told reporters in Port Dickson today.  <br>The Amanah youth wing said this would demonstrate unity with the Warisan leadership in the election. However, PKR Sabah had rejected Amanah's suggestion, calling it “regressive” and “not strategic”.
