India Today has brought to light exclusive pictures of the graves of Chinese soldiers in Ladakh's Galwan valley clash, showing a different story to what the Chinese side had claimed. So far, China had been very secretive about its casualties in Galwan Valley PP14 hand to hand fight with the Indian Army. The images that appeared in the social media were first brought to public light by India Todayâ€™s OSINT team with cyber expert Saikiran Kannan. The first picture of the grave of Chen Xiangrong was exposed which showed the death that took place in a border defence action in the month of June 2020. The recent pictures show the graves being visited by PLA soldiers on at least two occasions. The video shows soldiers paying obeisance thrice at the obelisk.
