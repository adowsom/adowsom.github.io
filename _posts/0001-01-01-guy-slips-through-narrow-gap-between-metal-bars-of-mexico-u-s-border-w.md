This guy was at the Mexico-U.S border, checking out the series of vertical barriers between the two countries. He put his leg through the gap between two metal bars and then tried to slip his entire body through the narrow gap. To the amazement of his friends, he succeeded in doing so and slipped out of the gap to the other side of the wall.
