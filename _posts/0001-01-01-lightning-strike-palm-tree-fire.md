Occurred on August 18, 2020 / Phoenix, Arizona, USA  <br>Info from Licensor: On August 18th at about 10 pm my pregnant wife and I were watching TV and heard a massive BOOM! It was so loud that we literally thought a bomb went off. I quickly ran outside and saw fire only a few houses down our street. The closer I got it was obvious that lightning struck this palm tree. It was up in a blaze in a matter of seconds! Most likely because of how dry it's been and the multiple days of record heat Phoenix has received. Phoenix Fire Dept was on the scene in a matter of minutes and was able to put the fire out without any more damage to the surrounding trees and homes.
