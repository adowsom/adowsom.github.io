Ed Sheeran embarked on his first tour in 2011 after releasing his debut album &quot;+&quot;. The successful album drove Sheeran to tour for the next two years. He further propelled his career when he opened for Taylor Swift's Red Tour in 2013, playing his biggest venues yet. Over the next few year Sheeran would launch two more headlining tours, and even open for the Rolling Stones. To date, Ed Sheeran has performed over 800 shows across 3 concert tours.
