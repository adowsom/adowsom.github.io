Bagan MP and former finance minister Lim Guan Eng has challenged the finance ministry to reveal details of the 101 government projects worth RM6.61 billion that were allegedly awarded by the Pakatan Harapan administration without open tender.  <br>Lim suggested that the finance ministry was unwilling to do so because it would expose current Perikatan Nasional cabinet ministers who pushed for those direct-award contracts.
