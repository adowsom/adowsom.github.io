This girl decided to flush an entire toilet paper roll in an airplane toilet. With the roll still in the stand, she unrolled a few layers into the toilet bowl and flushed it. The toilet paper flew off the rack and went straight into the pot, making a horrific screechy noise that was heard by the entire plane.
