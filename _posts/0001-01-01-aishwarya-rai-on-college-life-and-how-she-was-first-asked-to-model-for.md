Bollywood actress Aishwarya Rai speaks about how she entered in modelling and film industry. She says &quot;Well, I am from Mangalore but I lived my life in Bombay. I am a complete Bombayite. I studied in Bombay only... from school to college. People used to call me cute when I was a kid. It could be because of my eyes or brown hair. One of my professor in college requested me to do a fashion feature in a magazine. She was doing photojournalism in some magazines. She was my English professor. That is how I entered into modelling. After becoming Miss world people listen to me carefully. They took me far more seriously. My approach became a little more responsible and definitely, I became a full-fledged media personality or what a people call celebrity. Before entering the film Industry I was already used to with used to with the camera, studio, atmosphere etc. It was not a culture shock for me but it was a new medium for me and I did not have any acting experience. I love my work, a camera is just an instrument.&quot; This footage is part of the broadcast stock footage archive of Wilderness Films India Ltd., the largest collection of HD imagery from South Asia.
