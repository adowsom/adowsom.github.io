Refusing permission for Muharram processions in the country over the weekend, the Supreme Court today said it would lead to chaos and one particular community will be targeted for spreading the coronavirus. The Supreme Court was hearing a petition by Syed Kalbe Jawad from Uttar Pradesh, who cited the June order permitting the Rath Yatra festival in Odisha. CJI SA Bobde said that everyone's health can't be put at risk. The Supreme Court spoke about the difficulty of blanket permission for the country and said even the state governments were not party to the petition. The petitioner asked for permission for a procession in Lucknow, saying that a large number of Muslims of the Shia community live in the UP capital.
