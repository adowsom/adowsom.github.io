A mechanic in Badung, Indonesia has created a double-ended car which has two steering wheels.  <br>Roni Gunawan, a 73-year-old grandfather, is the owner of this two-faced car and is the head of the workshop at Gemah Ripah taxi company.  <br>Gunawan purchased two cars for modification purposes and the three-month process involved three welders, three painters, and several mechanics.  <br>&quot;The welding process started with cutting the cars to combine them. The welding took two months because the length and height of the chassis had to be the same. After that, the painting process took approximately one month. So in total, it took about three months and a half to complete the project,&quot; said Cecep, Gunawan's assistant.  <br>Cecep also said: &quot;The police said the vehicle cannot be driven on public roads.&quot;  <br>This footage was filmed on August 24.
