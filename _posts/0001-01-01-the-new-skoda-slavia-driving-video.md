31 trainees from the renowned ŠKODA vocational school combine history and modernity with the seventh ŠKODA trainee car: in the anniversary year of ŠKODA AUTO, the open ŠKODA SLAVIA is reminiscent of the first bicycles that Václav Laurin and Václav Klement produced after the company was founded in 1895 . The Spider variant of the ŠKODA SCALA combines the clear and emotional lines of the modern compact model with the early days of the automobile, when the vehicles were mostly open. From the first drawing to the construction of the one-off, the trainees carried out all the work steps themselves with the support of their trainers and ŠKODA experts from the areas of design, production and technical development. The seventh ŠKODA trainee car since 2014 once again demonstrates the high quality of training at the ŠKODA vocational school in Mladá Boleslav.
