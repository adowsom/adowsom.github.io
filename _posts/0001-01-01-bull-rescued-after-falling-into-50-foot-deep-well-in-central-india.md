A bull was rescued after falling into a 50-foot-deep well in the village of Arewadi, central India, on July 16.  <br>Footage shows the rescuers tying the trapped animal with ropes and hauling it up, with the help of a crane.  <br>Residents of the village had previously tried to lift the bull out with no success, and the bull attacked people who climbed down to rescue it.  <br>A team of rescuers led by Dr. Rakesh Chittora went to the village and started the six-hour recovery operation.  <br>Dr. Rakesh Chittora, Senior Veterinary in Animal Rahat, said: â€œWe took its body temperature, which was normal, but the bull was under stress, so we immediately administered an anti-stress injection. He was dehydrated as well, so saline was administered. Multivitamins and painkillers were also administered.  <br>&quot;Then bull was examined for any lameness or fractured bones, but fortunately after one hour of rest, the owner took his bull home.&quot;
