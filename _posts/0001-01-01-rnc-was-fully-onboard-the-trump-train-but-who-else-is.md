While the Republican National Convention this week has clearly indicated President Donald Trump now owns the GOP, one question remains.  <br>Can the Republican party survive in an America growing irreversibly more diverse through the 2020s?  <br>According to CNN, the 2016 GOP convention rippled with unresolved tension and 'never Trumpers.'  <br>But the conspicuous absence of dissent at this year's event underscores how the party has been stamped with 'Trump,' just like a downtown skyscraper.  <br>Trump's dream of turning America's demographic clock backwards is appealing to a narrower and smaller base.  <br>And with the GOP's wholesale jump onto the 'Trump train,' the party could be locked into a cycle of contraction that makes Republicanism increasingly irrelevant.  <br>It's going to get more insular, more monolithic, more intense, and it's going to repel more voters who are not in the tribe.
