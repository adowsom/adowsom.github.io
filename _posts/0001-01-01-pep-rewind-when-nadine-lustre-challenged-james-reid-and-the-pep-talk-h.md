#PEPrewind Nadine Lustre and James Reid were among the celebrities who dropped by PEP.ph (Philippine Entertainment Portal)'s online showbiz talkshow PEP Talk to promote their projects.   <br>Back in 2014, Nadine and James were promoting their first film together as a loveteam, the Wattpad novel-turned-movie &quot;Diary Ng Panget.&quot;  <br>It was a fun and telling interview, with James and Nadine showing hints back then that their reel romance could turn into a real one.   <br>JaDine was not a thing yet, back then.  <br>Check out the moment when they both gazed at each other when asked about the possibility of a real romance between them.   <br>But the real fun part of this PEP Talk episode was when the pair were asked about their secret special talents.  <br>James showed his &quot;cheek thing,&quot; while Nadine amazed everyone with her special arm trick.   <br>Nadine said it was an easy trick, so she challenged James and PEP Talk hosts Demai G. Sunio-Granali and Nikko Angelo Tuazon to try it.  <br>Watch the video to see if they succeeded in Nadine's challenge.
