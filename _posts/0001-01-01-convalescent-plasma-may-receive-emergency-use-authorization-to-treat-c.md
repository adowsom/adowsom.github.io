Convalescent plasma is created from the blood of people who have recovered from the novel coronavirus COVID-19.  <br>CNN reports convalescent plasma already shown some success in two other deadly coronaviruses: MERS and SARS.  <br>However, like blood, convalescent plasma is in limited supply and must come from donors.  <br>And while there are promising signals from some studies, there is not yet any randomized clinical trial data on convalescent plasma to treat COVID-19.  <br>Sources say a White House briefing Sunday is expected to be about an emergency use authorization for the use of convalescent plasma to treat COVID-19.  <br>Last week, President Trump accused some health officials of playing politics regarding an EUA for convalescent plasma.
