This person saw Harper, the dog, sticking out her nose from a hole in a fence. She brought a ball and left it at the hole when she saw this person there. So they decided to play with the dog and threw the ball to the other side of the fence, which she fetched. She did this every time they threw the ball for her, enjoying each other's company.
