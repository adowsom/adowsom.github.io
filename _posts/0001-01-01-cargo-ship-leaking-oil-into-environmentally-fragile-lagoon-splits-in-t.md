CNN reports a Japanese-owned ship leaking tons of oil off the coast of Mauritius has split apart.  <br>The MV Wakashio ran aground at Pointe d'Esny in late July and began leaking tons of oil into a pristine Indian Ocean lagoon last week.  <br>One of the ship's three oil tanks was already leaking into the ocean. Crews were attempting to remove the oil from the other tanks before the ship broke up.  <br>The spill is close to two environmentally protected marine ecosystems and the Blue Bay Marine Park reserve.  <br>Popular tourist beaches and mangrove plantations are nearby. Mauritius Prime Minister Pravind Jugnauth has declared a state of environmental emergency.  <br>We are in a situation of environmental crisis. Kavy Ramano Minister for the Environment, Mauritius
