Actress Ellen Pompeo has been on &quot;Grey's Anatomy&quot; for 17 seasons.  <br>The actress recently appeared on Dax Shepard's podcast &quot;Armchair Expert.&quot;  <br>She said she hasn't loved watching herself go from 33 to 50 onscreen.  <br>&quot;But at the same time, I think the overall goal of my life is to always keep my ego in check.&quot;  <br>Pompeo talked about when she wants to make her exit.  <br>&quot;To leave while the show is still on top is definitely a goal.&quot;  <br>&quot;I'm not trying to stay on the show forever. No way. &quot;  <br>Pompeo said she would leave if she gets too aggravated and no longer grateful.
