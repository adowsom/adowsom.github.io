This is the adorable moment a wild elephant stole food from a wildlife ranger's office for a late-night snack.  <br>Auncha Poltawee from Thai Wildlife Guardians recorded the jumbo named Rod Thung walking into the keepers' area in Rayong, eastern Thailand on August 19 looking for food.  <br>Rod Thung was seen using its long trunk to reach inside the hut while rummaging around for something edible before leaving with its meal.  <br>Although the elephant is friendly with humans, the staff said that he has quite an appetite.  <br>Auncha said: &quot;Rod Thung is adorable but he loves eating. He sometimes knocks at the office door just to greet and say hello. Rod Thung has never harmed anyone.&quot;  <br>There are an estimated 2,000 elephants living in the wild in Thailand and a similar number in captivity.  <br>They roam through the country's deep jungle and its protected national parks.
