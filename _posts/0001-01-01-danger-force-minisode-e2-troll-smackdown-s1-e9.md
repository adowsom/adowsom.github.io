On Gabbin' With Gaperman's next edition, Mary welcomes Dr. Minyak onto the show, who thinks that the show title is bizarre. Mary takes it as a compliment but Trent says that it was actually an insult; Mary mutes Trent and asks Minyak about his new faster class. Minyak explains it and Mary shows some sneak peeks. In the class, Minyak introduces himself and the show and gets started. He explains that usually after being defeated, Captain Man cries in defeat. He claims that one time he didn't even know Captain Man was defeated; he just looked over and saw him limp.
