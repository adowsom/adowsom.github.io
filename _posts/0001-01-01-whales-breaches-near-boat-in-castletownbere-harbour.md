Occurred on August 17, 2020 / Ireland  <br>Info from Licensor: &quot;I was out the previous day and video humpback whales in Dunmanus Bay, I was going out again with 3 of my children and my girlfriend's child when we saw a pod of dolphins and stopped to watch them, I was recording a dolphin swimming underneath the boat when a minke whale appeared from nowhere with its mouth full of sprat, we got a fright but the kids all insisted on staying out longer.&quot;
