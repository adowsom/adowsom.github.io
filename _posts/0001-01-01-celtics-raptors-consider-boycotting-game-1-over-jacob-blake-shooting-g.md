Fred Van Vleet suggest the Toronto Raptors may boycott their round two matchup with the Celtics to focus on the Jacob Blake shooting. Blake, a Black man, was shot from behind seven times by a police officer in Wisconsin and survived. Brad Stevens, Jaylen Brown and Marcus Smart spoke out forcefully against the shooting, but said the team did not yet discuss a boycott themselves. Should they? Could taking attention away from basketball help the continued Black Lives Matter movement? Sierra Goodwill, Bobby Manning and Jimmy Toscano discuss on The Garden Report.   <br>The CLNS Media Network is the leading provider for video/audio content.
