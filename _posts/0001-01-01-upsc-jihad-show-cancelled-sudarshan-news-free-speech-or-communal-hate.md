A show that claimed to expose how Muslims are taking over the bureaucracy did not air at its slotted time of 8 pm on Friday, 28th August, after the Delhi High Court stayed it. The show, which claimed to be an expose on infiltration of Muslims in the civil services, was to be aired on Sudarshan News, however the channel decided not to go ahead. Meanwhile, many people have chastised Sudarshan News for spreading communal hatred and suggesting that the civil services are compromised.   <br>TAGS: #SudarshanNews #SureshChavhanke #UPSCjihad
