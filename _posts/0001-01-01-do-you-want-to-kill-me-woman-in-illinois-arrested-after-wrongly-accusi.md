For what was supposed to be a peaceful sunny day in Winnetka, Illinois, for Otis Campbell and his friends, Tamara and Caitlyn, turned into a gloomy unpleasant day when a woman allegedly approached them aggressively, yelling at them to leave on Monday (August 17).   <br>The woman claimed they were in private property and that they needed passes for them to be in that area.   <br>&quot;I take a bike ride every day to relax at the pier all the time, the staff knows me,&quot; Campbell said. &quot;I see a lady starring at us, and I noticed it.&quot;   <br>Campbell told Newsflare that the woman approached Campbell and his friends, demanding to see their passes. He also told Newsflare that the woman said: &quot;This is America, you're not supposed to be here.&quot;   <br>The woman walked to a staff member wanting to complain.   <br>&quot;To walk up and down this driveway and onto the pier, they don't need passes,&quot; the staff member said.  <br>As the staff member calls a manager to assist, the woman turns to the filmer and says: &quot;it's not funny, do you want to kill me?&quot;   <br>&quot;Is it because I'm black?&quot; Campbell responded.   <br>The woman responded yes to that question.   <br>Campbell called the police, and they arrested her on battery charges.  <br>&quot;They charged a racist white woman today with battery after she racially profiled us,&quot; Campbell said.
