Trump Jr. calls Biden 'Loch Ness Monster of the swamp'  <br>In his address at the RNC on Monday, Donald Trump Jr. slammed his father's Democratic challenger as being a member of the &quot;swamp&quot; and said he wants people to learn from history, “not erase it&quot; by tearing down monuments. Trump Jr. said that “Biden has promised to take that money back out of your pocket and keep it in the swamp,&quot; Donald Trump Jr. said. &quot;That makes sense though, considering Joe Biden is basically the Loch Ness Monster of the swamp.&quot;   <br>Reuters brings you the latest business, finance and breaking news video from around the globe.
