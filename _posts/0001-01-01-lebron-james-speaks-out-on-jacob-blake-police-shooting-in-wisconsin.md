Love his hoops or hate it, NO ONE can complain or criticize LeBron James for his brave, outspoken presence off the court when it comes to crime, poverty and civil rights. Following the Los Angeles Lakers win over the Portland Trailblazers, LeBron remarked on the Jacob Blake brutal shooting by police officers in Wisconsin. James emphatically reiterated how “afraid” the black community is of police in America in 2020.
