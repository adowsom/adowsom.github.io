Joel Embiid chides a &quot;stupid question&quot; about who's to blame for the 76ers failures as he maintained hope for the current core's future. They didn't fail, he said, as much as injuries and missing shots in the series undermined Philadelphia's season.   <br>The CLNS Media Network is the leading provider for video/audio content.
