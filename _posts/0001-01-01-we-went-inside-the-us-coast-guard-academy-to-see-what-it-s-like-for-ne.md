We got an inside look at what it's like on the first day for new freshmen, known as &quot;Swabs,&quot; at the United States Coast Guard Academy in New London, Connecticut. Day one marks the beginning of &quot;Swab Summer,&quot; a challenging seven-week basic training program all future cadets are required to complete. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, all swabs entered a 14-day restriction-of-movement period, known as ROM. According to the Academyâ€™s superintendent, all 271 swabs tested negative for COVID-19. Their training officially began on day 15, which included a physical fitness exam, haircuts, sailing lessons, and drill practice on the Academy's Parade Field. Training is overseen by the Cadre, a group of juniors tasked with leading the swabs through the seven-week program.
