In a tweet, BJP IT Wing Chief says AIADMK leaders are impotent because they were hiding behind a saree for 30 years and only regained potency after meeting their leader in Delhi.    <br>BJP National Secretary H Raja said that Karnataka govt has allowed installation of Ganesh statues in public places and has also allowed public immersion because the government is won by 'potent' people.    <br>The Tamil Nadu State government has stated that there will not be any public procession or installation of any Ganesha idols in public place. They have appealed that everyone should celebrate Ganesh Chaturthi at their homes. This has not gone down well with many hindu groups in the state.   <br>India Today TV's Akshaya Nath tells us more.
