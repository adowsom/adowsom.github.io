Motorists were forced to flee as a wild elephant searched their vehicle for food in Sri Lanka.  <br>The incident took place at Kataragama Road in Buttala in Katagamuwa on August 11.  <br>The animal is seen rummaging through a family's car in search of food. The passengers are then forced to exit the vehicle.  <br>According to local reports, the family gave the elephant some bread to prevent the animal from harassing them further. The forest department officials rushed to the spot to avoid any animal-human conflict.  <br>The Sri Lankan elephant is an endangered species protected under the Sri Lankan law, with an estimated population of just 3,000.
