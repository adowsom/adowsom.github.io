This DIY dad built a bike from scratch after his son asked for a similar model in northern Indiaâ€™s Himachal Pradesh.  <br>Local media reports that Kamaljit, who works at a garage, constructed the bike from scratch in just one week, finishing his project by July 18.  <br>Footage shows Kamaljit welding the body of the bike to the tires and painting the frame a white colour.  <br>Sunny, his lucky son, can be seen riding his bike.  <br>Kamaljit said the bike cost around INR 10,000 (USD $133) to build and can easily be transformed into a motorbike by affixing a motor to the pedals.
