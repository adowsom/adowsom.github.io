The head of the Sabah chapters of BN and Umno Bung Moktar Radin today reasserted his authority over the coalition by declaring that he &quot;runs the game&quot; in Sabah.  <br>&quot;Sabah's people run the game. I run the game (in Sabah),&quot; said Bung when interviewed by CNA in Parliament today.  <br>Yesterday, national BN head Ahmad Zahid Hamidi said Bung will lead the coalition's election campaign in Sabah and that the latter will also choose the coalition's chief minister nominee.
