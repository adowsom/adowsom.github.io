California officials issued a rare warning Saturday for a “fire tornado” — or “firenado.”  <br>HuffPost reports the new blaze is raging in the eastern Sierra Mountains, close to the small community of Loyalton near Reno, Nevada.  <br>The wildfire grew to 20,000 acres by Saturday.  <br>The rapid expansion of the firestorm quickly triggered the rare warning from the National Weather Service.  <br>No injuries have been reported.  <br>pic.twitter.com/iDTWzXo7Y8 — Truckee Meadows Fire &amp; Rescue (@TMFPD) August 16, 2020 “Fire behavior is extreme, and a smoke column will be visible throughout the Sierra Valley and North Reno,” Forest Service officials warned Saturday.
