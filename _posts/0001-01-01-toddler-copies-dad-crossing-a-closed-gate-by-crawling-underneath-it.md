While out for an evening walk with her parents, this toddler saw her dad go under a closed gate. She clapped for him excitedly, followed by imitating him. She attempted to go under it, thinking she'll hit her head, she crawled on the ground to get under the gate. She didn't realize that she would be able to clear the gate by walking beneath the barrier without barely ducking.
