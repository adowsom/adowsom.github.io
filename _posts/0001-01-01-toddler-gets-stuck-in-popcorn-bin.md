This toddler was inventing new ways to eat all the popcorn by herself and not sharing it with her brother. She eventually decided to sit on the popcorn bin to prevent him from eating it. Unfortunately, she got stuck inside it and couldn't get out unless her dad pulled her. The little girl learned her lesson hilariously.
