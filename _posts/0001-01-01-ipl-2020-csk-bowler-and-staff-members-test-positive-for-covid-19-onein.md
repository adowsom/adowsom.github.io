Chennai Super Kings' preparations for the upcoming IPL season have run into complications after it emerged that a bowler and some staff members of the franchise tested positive for COVID-19. Ministers from six non-BJP-ruled states filed a review petition before the Supreme Court on Friday by challenging an August 17 order of Supreme Court which had allowed the central government to hold the NEET and JEE-Main exam in September despite the prevailing Covid -19 situation. Congress president Sonia Gandhi today tweeted a video statement asking the centre to &quot;listen&quot; to students who have raised concerns over holding national entrance exams for engineering and medical courses amid the coronavirus crisis. Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said on Friday he was resigning because of poor health, ending a stint at the helm of the worldâ€™s third-biggest economy.
