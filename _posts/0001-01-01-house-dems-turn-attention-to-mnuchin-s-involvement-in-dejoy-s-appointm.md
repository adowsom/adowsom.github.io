House Democrats are casting a beady eye on US Postal Service Postmaster General Louis DeJoy--and how he got the job.  <br>CNN reports House Dems are scrutinizing DeJoy's selection as postmaster general in May -- and the Trump administration's involvement in his appointment.  <br>The scrutiny comes in the wake of numerous cost-cutting measures that Democrats charge are causing unacceptable delays in mail delivery.  <br>They also say DeJoy has put the Postal Service's ability to handle the expected surge in mail-in ballots at risk.  <br>CNN reports DeJoy was previously CEO of a USPS contractor and a major donor to President Donald Trump.  <br>And while Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin claims he had no involvement in DeJoy's hiring, documents obtained by CNN indicate otherwise.
