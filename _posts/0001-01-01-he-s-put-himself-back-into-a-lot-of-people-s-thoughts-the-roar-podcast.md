Phil Smith and Mark Donnelly are back in this preview from the bonus August 24 edition to discuss Sunderland's return to action, transfer targets and the club's upcoming friendlies.  <br>The Black Cats were back with a bang on Saturday August 22 as they beat Gateshead 3-1, and we cast our eye over the win and the standout performances from the game - including that of Will Grigg.  <br>We also turn our attentions to the transfer front, looking at incomings, trialists and the Benji Kimpioka saga.  <br>You can listen to the podcast via Spotify, Apple Podcasts, Anchor or Soundcloud - as well as a host of other podcast providers.
