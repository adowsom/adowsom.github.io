The man known as the Golden State Killer was sentenced to life in prison on Friday in a California courtroom.  <br>According to CNN, Jospeh DeAngelo carried out 13 murders and dozens of rapes in the 1970s and '80s. At the time of his crimes, he was a police officer.  <br>DeAngelo's ex-wife broke her silence in a statement submitted to the court, but not expected to be read aloud.  <br>Sacramento attorney Sharon Huddle married DeAngelo in 1973. She said his actions have had 'a devastating and pervasive' effect on her life.  <br>Huddle never once refers to him by name and calls him 'the defendant' all through. She added she has since lost the ability to trust people.  <br>I now live every day with the knowledge of how he ... murdered 13 innocent people who were loved and have now been missed for 40 years or more.
