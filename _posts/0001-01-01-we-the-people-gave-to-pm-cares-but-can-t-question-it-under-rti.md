We all know that the PM CARES Fund was set up on 28th March 2020 to support the fight against COVID-19, and to help those in distress due to the crisis.  <br>Big corporate companies, Public Sector units donated hundreds of crores to PM CARES. Many citizens, people like you and me, also donated our small savings to PM CARES in good faith since the Prime Minister is the chairperson of the fund.  <br>We felt our money would be utilised well. But even so, as citizens or as donors, we would like to how PM CARES is using the money collected. But Prime Minister's Office or PMO says PM CARES is not a public authority and does not come under RTI.   <br>Video: The Quint  <br>Music: Big Bang Fuzz
