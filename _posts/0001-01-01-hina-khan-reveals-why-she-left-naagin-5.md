As the show launched it is garnered a lot of love from fans, however, in the recent episode Hina bid adieu to the supernatural show and fans are really disappointed seeing her go. As fans shared their sadness, Hina recently came out and addressed her exit, talking about it, Hina said, “I had made it pretty clear months ago that I don't want to do television for a while. I still stick to it. Ideally, I didn't want to do the three episodic things. I wasn't sure whether I should do it as I am exploring a different space. I really can't say no to Ekta and I really really respect her a lot. She approached me to launch the show, which is why I did it. I got such an overwhelming response from you all.” Now that she has left for good, Sanjivani star Surbhi Chandna took over the character alongside Mohit Malhotra and Sharad Malhotra. Hina further urged her fans to continue watching the show for such talented star cast and unique storyline. The actor further requested everyone not to troll anyone as it was her personal decision which she couldn’t inform earlier.
