Scientists at Poland's Warsaw zoo have been taking blood, saliva and other samples from the zoo’s three elephants.  <br>In recent days zookeepers have begun to prepare to test whether giving Elephants hemp oil can reduce their stress.  <br>A zoo veterinarian, said hemp oil, also known as CBD, has been shown to reduce anxiety and stress in other animals.  <br>The zoo’s experts wonder if the oil could also help giraffes, rhinos, and polar bears.  <br>They have decided, however, to start their tests on the elephants. who have undergone a period of stress.  <br>If the study works as hoped, the oil will merely “calm them down a little bit,” and have anti-inflammatory and other benefits.
