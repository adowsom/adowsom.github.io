Eight-year-old Greyson Winfield is helping the people who need it most in his community of Conway, South Carolina. Greyson has been cutting the grass for key workers and helping to feed the hungry in a bid to simply make people smile. He recently started an organisation called “Helping Footprint” which helps buy food and pay bills for families in need.
