Message from the composer and creator of Calmante Relaxamento: &quot;I am a composer from Norway and started this channel with a simple vision: to create a place where you can visit whenever you want to sit back and relax. I compose music that can be special like: music to sleep, music to calm, music for yoga, music to study, peaceful music, beautiful music and relaxing music. I love composing music and I invested a lot of work in it. Thank you very much for listening and leaving your comment. Every day, I am completely surprised by all your warm support and it really inspires me to work even harder on my music. If you appreciate my work, I would be very happy if you decide to sign up and join our community. Have a wonderful day or night! &quot;
