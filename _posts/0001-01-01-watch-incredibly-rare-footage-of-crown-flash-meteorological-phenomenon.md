Local resident Daniel De Rose captured this amazing footage of a Crown Flash. This rarely seen meteorological occurs over thunderhead clouds and has the appearance of aurora-like streamers emanating into the clear atmosphere.  <br>Daniel shot this video in Stuart, Florida and describes the scene &quot;The weather was beautiful, temperature low to mid-90s, humidity around 80%+/-, winds 10-15mph. The cloud took about 40min  to become a dark thunderstorm cloud and about an hour or so before it produced thunder. There was a halo around the sun which was about 50% faded when the flash started. Along the top edge of the cloud, there was a whiter smoother border that through polarized sunglasses was purplish pink and green and almost translucent but didn't show any color in photos. &quot;  <br>Daniel says the crown flash lasted approximately 10-15 minutes
