Former prime minister Dr Mahathir Mohamad today alleged that his successor Muhyiddin Yassin was &quot;afraid&quot; of losing the support of six MPs and was now seeking &quot;replacements&quot;.  <br>&quot;He is finding replacements. Where from? Perhaps PKR. But the cost is high,&quot; wrote Mahathir on his blog &quot;chedet.cc&quot; today.  <br>So far, Muhyiddin has managed to pass legislation in Parliament with the support of 111 MPs at most, while the opposition mustered no better than 109 in opposing.
