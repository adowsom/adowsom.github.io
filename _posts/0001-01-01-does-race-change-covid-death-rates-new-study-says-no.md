White Americans hospitalized with COVID-19 are just as likely to die from the disease as Black Americans.  <br>This is according to a study published Tuesday by JAMA Network Open, reports UPI.  <br>Just over 23% of White patients with COVID-19 being treated in the hospital ultimately died.  <br>This is in comparison to 19% of Black patients who ultimately die, the data showed.  <br>Research shows that Black and Hispanic Americans are hospitalized up to three times more often.  <br>However, with access to care, the death rates appear to even out between races.
