Indigenous peoples make up nearly 5% of Canada's population, and disparities in young peoples' educational and recreational opportunities are acute.  <br>Housing is inadequate on many reserves with some remote communities cut off from the rest of Canada for weeks or months during the year.  <br>Among Canada's First Nations' youth, depression and suicide is already over 3 times the average of non-indigenous people.  <br>CNN reports the pandemic is adding a layer of risk to young indigenous lives. Government officials say the impact on mental health may linger for years.  <br>For months this year, children, parents, and entire rural, indigenous communities were left without the support they had fought so hard to establish.  <br>Living in a reserve it gets depressing over time. You begin to feel isolated, you find yourself parting ways with your friends. It takes a huge toll on your health. Farrah Dixon Norway House Cree Nation, Manitoba, Canada
