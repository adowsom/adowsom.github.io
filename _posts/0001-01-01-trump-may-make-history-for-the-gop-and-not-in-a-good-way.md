A loss on election day by President Donald Trump this year would mean the Republicans have lost the popular vote 7 out of the last 8 elections since 1992.  <br>According to CNN, Republican presidential candidates will have averaged a mere 45.2% of the popular vote since 1992.  <br>The optimistic view for the party is simply that the popular vote is the wrong metric for understanding Republicans' strength.  <br>The purpose of running in an election is to win the election, and the GOP is doing so on the presidential level.  <br>After all, they have won three of the last seven presidential elections. And if Trump wins again in November, it will be four of eight.  <br>The pessimistic view for Republicans is that the electoral college/popular vote splits have mostly been luck.  <br>George W. Bush only won Florida and with it the presidency by 537 votes in 2000.  <br>And despite losing the popular vote by millions, Trump won in 2016 by carrying the determining states by less than a point.
