Senior advocate Prashant Bhushan on Monday filed a supplementary statement refusing to apologise in a contempt case against him in Supreme Court   <br>He said, &quot;My tweets represented this bonafide belief that I continue to hold. Public expression of these beliefs was I believe, in line with my higher obligations as a citizen and a loyal officer of this court. Therefore, an apology for expression of these beliefs, conditional or unconditional, would be insincere. An apology cannot be a mere incantation and any apology has to, as the court has itself put it, be sincerely made.   <br>Prashant Bhushan was convicted by the Supreme Court for criminal contempt of court over his tweets against the judiciary and CJI SA Bobde.
