Adam Dougherty is a special effects artist. He creates realistic silicone figures modeled after famous cartoon characters. Adam shapes the character out of clay, creates a mold, pours silicone in the mold, and then paints and adds hair to the character to bring it to life. Characters he has made include Grunkle Stan from &quot;Gravity Falls,&quot; Mojo Jojo from &quot;The Powerpuff Girls,&quot; and Klaus from &quot;American Dad.&quot; Adam displays the characters in film, stop motion, and art shows.
