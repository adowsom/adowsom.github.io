At least one person was killed and dozens were trapped after a five-storey building collapsed in India, late on August 24, 2020. Rescuers managed to pull at least 60 people from the rubble, but a local legislator has warned that dozens more could still be buried in the debris. The building, which comprised 47 flats, is in the township of Mahad, 120km (75 miles) south of the countryâ€™s most populous city, Mumbai.
