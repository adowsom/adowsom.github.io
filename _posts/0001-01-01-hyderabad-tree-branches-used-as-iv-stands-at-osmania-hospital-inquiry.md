Several videos of tree branches or wooden sticks being used as stands for intravenous (IV) administration at Hyderabad's Osmania Hospital went viral on Sunday. The incident raised questions on hospital administration and triggered massive outrage among people. The 100-year-old hospital has been in news earlier for flooded wards, protests by sanitation workers and allegations of poor healthcare facilities. The viral videos showing poor medical infrastructure at the hospital have prompted the healthcare authorities to launch an investigation into the incident. Meanwhile, the hospital Superintendent denied that there is a lack of medical equipment in the hospital and launched an enquiry into the matter. New saline stands for the patients admitted to Quli Qutb Shah block were made available by the authorities.
