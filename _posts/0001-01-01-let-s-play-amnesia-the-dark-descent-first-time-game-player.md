Let's Play Amnesia, the Dark Descent horror PC game.    <br>I do not have any game playing skills so you can see where this is going?  And I can honestly say you are probably not going to see anyone play this game quite like this ever again.  Let's hope.  <br>So, follow me into dark hallways, malls, dungeons and areas that I shouldn't be in at all!   <br>Probably doing things I shouldn't be doing maybe?  Just to see what happens.  <br>I have not read about this game.  And, I don't have cheats.  <br>My apologies for the louder music in comparison to my voice levels.  It was my first time recording game play and using this mic.  Baby steps.  I promise to get better.  Maybe.  <br>This game ROCKS  I just signed up with Steam and started playing &quot;Amnesia&quot; for the first time ever this week.  Let's see how far I can take it before I get munched for good!?  <br>Oh, and I scare easily.  This is gonna be a fun trip.  For me at the very least.   <br>PLAY FIRST, CUDDLE LATER!  <br>⚡WARNING⚡  for FOUL LANGUAGE  <br>Daily Uploads &amp; Weekly live streaming
