If there’s a time to be totally unfiltered, it’s now.   <br>We got the star-studded cast of ‘The One and Only Ivan’ to share their most unfiltered opinions on both the current state of the world and their experiences with the rest of the cast. What does Angelina Jolie care most about right now? What’s Danny DeVito really like on set? We got to the heart of these matters and honored the magnificent story of Ivan the Gorilla along the way.  <br>Watch ‘The One and Only Ivan’ on Disney+ now! Directed by Thea Sharrock and starring Bryan Cranston, Angelina Jolie, Helen Mirren, Sam Rockwell, Danny DeVito, and so many more of your faves!
