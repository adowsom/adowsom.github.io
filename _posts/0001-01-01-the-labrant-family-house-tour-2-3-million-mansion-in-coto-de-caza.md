The LaBrant family are about as close to YouTube royalty as it gets. Not to mention they get to film a ton of their content from their beautiful California ranch. But even prior to their family channel taking off, Savannah Soutas made her claim to fame through the now defunct social media app Musical.ly where she had millions of followers. And it doesn’t end there with celebrity in this family. Savannah’s daughter from a previous relationship, the pint-sized Everleigh, is a star too. In fact, last year she was listed as number three on a list of the richest YouTube kids in the world. Since joining forces and becoming the world-famous LaBrant family, Cole and Savannah have had another daughter named Posie, and recently, a newborn son named Zealand. And as soon as those two are old enough to speak, they’ll no doubt be as famous as their older sister who has her own YouTube channel called Everleigh Opens Toys, which boasts a 3.38 Million subscriber count. Needless to say, the LaBrant family has the YouTube platform locked-down with their wholesome, Christian-family inspired lifestyle. They’ve monetized it into a lucrative revenue stream as social media influencers that often film their vids from the comfort of their own beautiful home.  <br>#TheLaBrantFam #HouseTour #RealEstate #Ladera #California #LuxuryEstate #YouTuberHouse #YouTubeFamily #HouseTour2020
