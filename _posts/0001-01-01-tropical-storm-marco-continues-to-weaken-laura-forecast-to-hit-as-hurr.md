Tropical Storm Marco continues to weaken, Laura forecast to hit as hurricane  <br>Marco continued weakening Sunday night as it faced wind shear and dry air in the central-northern Gulf of Mexico. It was downgraded to a tropical storm Sunday night, and it is forecast to stay a tropical storm as it skirts the Louisiana coastline on Monday.   <br>It is still expected to bring rain, storm surge and tropical storm force winds to Louisiana on Monday.  <br>Meanwhile, Tropical Storm Laura has knocked utilities out as it battered Hispaniola, following a track forecast to take it to the same part of the U.S. coast later in the week, also as a hurricane.  <br>Marco weakened to become a tropical storm Sunday evening due to wind shear and dry air in the central-northern Gulf. As of early Monday, its winds had weakened to 65 mph.  <br>This is a good thing for southeast Louisiana, as it means a lesser wind threat - but we could still get some tropical storm force winds of 39 mph or higher across southeast Louisiana. Tropical storm warnings are in effect for the New Orleans area and Northshore.  <br>The center of the small storm is in the central-northern Gulf of Mexico. The forecast is for its center to skirt the Louisiana coastline on Monday.
