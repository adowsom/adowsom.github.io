The Fernando de Noronha archipelago off the coast of Brazil has a new travel restriction.  <br>You can go only if you show you have had COVID-19, reports CNN.  <br>It will reopen next week to people who can show their positive test is at least 20 days old.  <br>They will also take the result of the serological test showing the presence of antibodies.  <br>This decision may prove short-sighted as many scientists are unsure if people can be reinfected.  <br>Fernando de Noronha has been closed to tourists since mid-March because of the pandemic.
