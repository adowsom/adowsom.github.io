Like tourist hotspots worldwide, the Indonesian island of Bali has taken an enormous hit from the coronavirus pandemic.  <br>According to CNN, hotel arrivals in July were down over 99% year on year, and Bali is missing out on over$650 million of income every month.  <br>According to CNN, tens of thousands of local workers have been officially furloughed, generally without pay.  <br>Thousands have lost formal jobs, and many workers in Bali's large informal tourist economy are desperate.  <br>That's why local officials hope, with government permission, that they'll be able to open up on September 11th--an auspicious day in the Hindu calendar.  <br>Opening up won't come easily. Flights are limited, and tourists still have to be in quarantine for the first two weeks of their stay.  <br>And unfortunately, Bali doesn't have the best reputation for managing COVID-19 outbreaks.
