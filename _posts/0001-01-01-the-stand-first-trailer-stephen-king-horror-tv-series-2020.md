You can watch the Stand teaser in the video above. The miniseries will begin its run on CBS All Access starting December 17.  <br>So what are we in for? For one thing, thereâ€™s kindly, reassuring Whoopi Goldberg as Mother Abagail, a symbol for good, plus smirking, tall Alexander Skarsgard as her counterpart, Lucifer-like Randall Flagg. You also get glimpses of some of the mortal cast, among them James Marsden, Greg Kinnear, Odessa Young, Heather Graham, and more.
