If you see a white bump on or near your lip, you might wonder: Is this a zit, or a cold sore?  <br>According to Allure Magazine, pimples and herpes simplex virus cold sores can look startlingly similar, especially when one first appears.  <br>To determine what it is, consider if it burned or tingled before it even appeared. That's a signal of a cold sore, before it travels up the nerve root to the skin.  <br>Cold sores also appear in tiny clusters, whereas pimples never do.  <br>Also, pimples can only appear where oil glands are present. Since there are no oil glands on the lips, it's impossible to have a pimple there.  <br>Cold sores are contagious, acne is not. Still, 60 million Americans have acne, and 50 to 80% carry the herpes simplex virus.  <br>So if you have cold sores, or acne, or both, just know that you are not alone!
