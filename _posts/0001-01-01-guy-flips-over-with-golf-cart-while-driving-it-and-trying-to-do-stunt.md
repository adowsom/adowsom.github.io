This guy unloaded a golf cart from a truck and started driving it on the ground. He tried to do a J-turn stunt but failed to do so in the first attempt. Due to immediate braking, the golf cart flipped and fell on the side. However, the guy picked the cart up and did spins on the ground before putting it back on the truck.
