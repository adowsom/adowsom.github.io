Mahabharat star Mukesh Khanna may have opened up a Pandoras Box with his recent comments on Bollywood against the backdrop of the Sushant Singh Rajput death case. In a couple of TV debates, Khanna claimed that there have been many murders in Bollywood which were allegedly declared as suicides in the past. His remarks were greeted with murmurs of disbelief and disregard, while some dismissed allegations of the actor. Now, Khanna’s statements have become a potential case of action in the form of a letter to Mumbai Police Commissioner Param Bir Singh, demanding that the utterances should form the basis for the police to re-investigate all Bollywood suicides that may have been potential murders in the past 50 years or so. Shiv Sena leader and Vasantrao Naik Sheti Swavlamban Mission, President Kishore Tiwari who is accorded the status of Minister of State has shot off the letter to the Mumbai CP for a thorough probe into Khanna’s allegations in public interest.
