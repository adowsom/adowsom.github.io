“Handling people’s ashes is such an honour, but also such a responsibility, and I work really hard to make sure people get exactly what they want,&quot; says Emma.  <br>“I’ve handled the ashes of people’s parents and grandparents, and one woman even asked me to create something to hold the ashes of her baby.  <br>“I’ve had people crying at the front door with joy when they collect things, and then I start crying along with them, it means so much.”  <br>For every item of cremation jewellery, no matter the shape or style, Emma charges just £10.  <br>“I want this to be something everyone can have,” says Emma, of Chesterfield.  <br>“I’d do it for free if I could.”
