At a time when even a scooty costs more than Rs 30,000, rickshaw-pullers here have found a novel and a cheaper way to ride high on speed. &quot;Jugad-gadi&quot; is a new avatar of the familiar three-wheeler but the only difference is that it is being run with a scooter engine. Jugaad are locally-made motor vehicles that are used mostly in small villages as a means of low cost transportation in rural India. Jugaad (also sometimes jugard) literally means an improvised arrangement or work-around, which has to be used because of lack of resources. This is a Hindi term widely used by people speaking other Indian languages, and by people of Indian origin around the world. The same term is still used for a type of vehicle, found in rural India, made by carpenters by fitting a diesel engine on a cart. Jugaad colloquially means a creative idea, or a quick workaround to get through commercial, logistic or law issues. As such, the Jugaad movement has gathered a community of enthusiasts, believing it to be the proof of Indian bubbling creativity, or a cost-effective way to solve the issues of everyday life There are numerous manufacturers of the Listeroid &amp; Petteroid diesel engines in single cylinder and two cylinder configurations, though Kirloskar was the first manufacturer to build them in India. Locally, these engines continue to be known as Kirloskar engines, even though made by a host of manufacturers. Brands include Ashwamegh, Noble, Kapson and Grover among others, and the manufacturers are spread over western UP from Ghaziabad to Meerut to Agra. Jugaads use these engines as the powerhouse. Generally, a single cylinder water cooled Petteroid engine is used.
