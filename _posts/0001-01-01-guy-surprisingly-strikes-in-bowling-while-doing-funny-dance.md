This guy was out enjoying with his friends at a bowling alley. He was goofing around doing a funny dance. He picked up the ball to take a shot while deliberately trying to look stupid. However, when the guy threw the bowling ball on the ramp, he surprisingly ended up striking all the pins down at one go.  <br>*The underlying music rights are not available for license.
