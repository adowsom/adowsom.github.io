In a small town in rural Japan, farmers have been dealing with hordes of hungry monkeys eating up their vegetables.  <br>Now, HuffPost reports help is on the way, in the form of three elderly women calling themselves the 'Monkey Busters.'  <br>The women are so dedicated to the cause they often show up to a monkey sighting still in their aprons, so not a moment of monkey-scaring is wasted.  <br>However, the Monkey Busters donâ€™t actually kill their targets.  <br>Instead, they fire warning shots that are followed up with firecrackers and other loud noises.
