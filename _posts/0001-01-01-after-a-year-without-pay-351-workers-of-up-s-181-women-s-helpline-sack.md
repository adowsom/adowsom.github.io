At least 351 women employees of the '181' helpline, run by the Uttar Pradesh government, have launched an indefinite protest in Lucknow against the non-payment of their salaries since July 2019. Adding insult to their injury, the state Cabinet announced the decision to integrate the '181' women helpline with the '112' police helpline â€“ essentially rendering all 351 women jobless.  <br>Video: The Quint  <br>Music: Big Bang Fuzz
