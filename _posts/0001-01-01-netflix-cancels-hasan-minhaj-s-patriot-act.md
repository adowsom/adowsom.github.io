Netflix has canceled Hasan Minhaj's political news-based comedy show, The Patriot Act.  <br>Minhaj broke the news on Twitter, saying a wealth of lovely things about the production.  <br>&quot;I got to work with the best writers, producers, researchers, and animators in the game. My 2 babies were born and grew up with the show. TY to @Netflix and everyone who watched.&quot;  <br>In 2019, the series found itself at the center of controversy over an episode on Saudi Arabia.  <br>Netflix removed it from streaming in Saudi Arabia after officials from the Kingdom complained.  <br>They viewed it as critical of Crown Prince MBS and his alleged role in the killing of Jamal Khashoggi.
