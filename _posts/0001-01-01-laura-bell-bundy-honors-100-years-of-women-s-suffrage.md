Laura Bell Bundy marks the centennial of women’s suffrage with a new single, “Get It Girl, You Go!,” honoring female trailblazers of the past and present. The actor and singer, known for her roles on the FX series “Anger Management” as well as the stage adaptations of “Hairspray” and “Legally Blonde,” is joined by fellow Broadway performers Shoshana Bean and Anika Noni Rose on the track. Together, the women evoke the Andrews Sisters in three-part harmony, name-checking Rep.
