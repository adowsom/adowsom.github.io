Porsche has proven the performance potential of the new Panamera even before the car’s world premiere: in a slightly camouflaged series production car, test driver Lars Kern completed a full lap of the legendary Nürburgring Nordschleife over a distance of 20.832 kilometres in 7:29.81 minutes. In the official ranking of Nürburgring GmbH, this time certified by a notary public now stands as a new record in the “executive cars” category.  <br>At an outside temperature of 22 degrees Celsius and with a track temperature of 34 degrees Celsius, Lars Kern (32) started the lap at 1.49 pm on 24 July 2020 and crossed the finish line 7:29.81 minutes later. The record-breaking Panamera was equipped with a racing seat and a safety cage as protection for the driver. The notary public also confirmed the series production status of the still camouflaged four-door saloon, which will celebrate its world premiere at the end of August. The Michelin Pilot Sport Cup 2 sports tyre developed especially for the new Panamera and used for the record lap will be optionally available after the market launch.
