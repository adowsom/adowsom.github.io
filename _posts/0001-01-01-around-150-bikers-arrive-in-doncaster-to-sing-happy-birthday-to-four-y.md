When doting mum Sarah Walters appealed for bikers to sing ‘Happy Birthday’ to her little boy at their Doncaster home, she hoped a handful might turn up. But when four year old Jayden Walters looked out of the window on Saturday (August 22) to see who had arrived, he was amazed to see over 150 had turned up on Norman Crescent, Rossington, to help him celebrate his fourth birthday!
