The Supreme court has rejected the petition seeking postponements of the Bihar polls due later this year. The apex court said that the Coronavirus crisis can't be a valid reason for putting the elections on hold and interfering with the powers of the Election Commission. The court called the petition premature as there is no notification announcing Bihar poll dates so far. The petitioner argued that the Supreme Court could seek a report from the Bihar disaster management authority on the coronavirus situation in the state. While dismissing the petition, the judges said that the The Election Commission will take care of every situation.
