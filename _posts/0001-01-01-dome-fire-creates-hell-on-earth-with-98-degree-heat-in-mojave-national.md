These were the hellish scenes as the Dome fire ravaged the Mojave National Preserve in California.  <br>Footage from August 17 shows the toll the fire has taken on the heroic firefighters and the destruction caused by the blaze.  <br>Local reports suggest that the Dome fire burnt over 20,000 acres within 24 hours.  <br>The filmer Daniel told Newsflare: &quot;This flared up right in front of our engine. Captain got out quick to try to knock it down. Thatâ€™s me filming while taking his gear to him.&quot;
