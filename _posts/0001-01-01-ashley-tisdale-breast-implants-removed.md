There has been an increase in patients seeking removal of their breast implants as of late, as New York City-based plastic surgeon Norman Rowe has previously shared with Allure. One of these patients includes Chrissy Teigen, who posted scars from her surgery on Instagram in late July. Now, Ashley Tisdale has shared with her fans that she has also undergone breast-implant removal surgery. Tisdale says that after dealing with a few health issues she believed were related to the initial surgery, she felt it was time to part with her implants.
