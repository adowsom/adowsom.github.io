This German Shepherd puppy loved sitting in her owner's chair when they were at work. When her owner came back and found her sitting on the chair, she hid behind it and played peekaboo with her. The dog tried to figure out who was touching her by looking here and there. Eventually, they stood on the chair and saw her owner lurking behind.
