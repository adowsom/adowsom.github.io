Hurricane Genevieve brings strong wind and rain to Cabo San Lucas in Mexico's Baja California peninsula this morning (August 20).  <br>Footage recorded at around 1am local time shows trees swaying as gusts from the category one hurricane touch the popular tourist resort.  <br>The U.S. National Hurricane Center said Genevieve lost power on Wednesday and was downgraded from a category four storm to just category one.  <br>Officials said that the hurricane was not expected to make landfall but it had claimed the lives of a 15-year-girl who was trapped by a large wave and an adult tried to save her on Tuesday.
