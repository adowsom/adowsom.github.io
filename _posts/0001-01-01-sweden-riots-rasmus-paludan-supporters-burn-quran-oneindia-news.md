Violence broke out in the Swedish city of Malmo on Friday after members of a far-right Danish party burnt a copy of the Quran. Earlier on Friday, the leader of the far-right Danish anti-immigration party Hard Line, Rasmus Paludan, was arrested near Malmo and banned from Sweden for 2 years before he could make it to a planned event in the city.   <br>#SwedishRiots #Quran #RasmusPaludan
