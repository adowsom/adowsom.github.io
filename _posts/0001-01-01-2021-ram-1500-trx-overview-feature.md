The new 2021 Ram 1500 TRX is the apex predator of the truck world and cements Ram Truck as North America’s off-road truck leader. The Ram 1500 TRX expands the light-duty lineup and sets the benchmark for extreme performance pickup trucks. Designed bolt by bolt to significantly outperform every other truck, the 2021 Ram 1500 TRX has been tested to handle the most punishing conditions with extreme durability. Powered by the 702-horsepower supercharged 6.2-liter HEMI® V-8 engine, the 2021 Ram 1500 TRX delivers a top speed of 118 mph on its way to being the quickest, fastest and most powerful mass-produced half-ton pickup truck in the world. New integrated fender flares add eight inches of body width, making room for new 18-inch wheels that are wrapped in specially designed 35-inch Wrangler Territory All-Terrain tires from Goodyear. This combination, paired with an all-new custom suspension composed of the highest quality components and tuning geared toward high-speed desert runs, produces even more capability on the street or in the desert.
