A federal judge on Thursday cleared the way for New York state prosecutors who want to see US President Donald Trump's accounting records.  <br>CNN reports Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance's office wants access to them for use in a grand jury investigation.  <br>US District Judge Victor Marrero's ruling follows a Supreme Court decision that shot down Trump's claim of presidential immunity from such an inquiry.  <br>DA Vance's office has been examining whether Trump or the Trump Organization violated state laws by making hush-money payments to Trump's lovers.  <br>Trump had sued Vance to stop the grand jury subpoena of his longtime accounting firm Mazars USA for years of his records.
