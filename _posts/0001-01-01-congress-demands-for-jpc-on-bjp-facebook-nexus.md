Accusing Facebook India of interfering with India’s electoral process, the Congress has demanded a joint parliamentary committee (JPC) to probe allegations.The demand has come after an investigation published by the Wall Street Journal which reported that officials of Facebook India provided “favourable treatment to the BJP on election related issues” and violated the company’s own guidelines on hate speech by refusing to take down objectionable comments by BJP leaders.  <br>#Facebook  #JPC #BJP #Congress #RSS #RahulGandhi
