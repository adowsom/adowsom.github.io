Joe Biden's poll numbers are slipping.  <br>The former Vice President is currently leading Pres. Donald Trump in the polls.  <br>He led by double digits over the summer.  <br>Now, his lead has dropped to low single digits - in some polls Trump is within the margin of error.  <br>In Wisconsin Biden is up by 3.5 points in the RealClearPolitics average.  <br>At this time in 2016 Hillary Clinton led Trump by 11.5 points.  <br>In the middle of a pandemic, economic collapse caused by the lockdowns, and racial strife Joe Biden is under performing.  <br>According to polling traditionally Democratic Minnesota Trump and Biden are virtually tied.  <br>The NY Post says the political analysts are puzzled as to why Biden's lead is drastically falling.
