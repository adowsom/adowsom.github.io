Honda jumped into the heavyweight adventure-touring segment in a big way with its 2016 Africa Twin. Over the years, Honda’s parallel-twin powered CRF has evolved into a highly capable rig that blends the finest features from the adventure off-road and sport-touring segments. And the Africa Twin Adventure Sport ES DCT is the best example to date offering an ultra high-tech riding experience like nothing we’ve seen in this segment. Read the 2020 Honda Africa Twin Adventure Sport ES DCT MC Commute Review for an in-depth evaluation. In this video we share a condensed review analysis after riding it for a few hundred miles on, and off pavement. Tune in as we address some of its best features, and a few squawks, too.  <br>See more photos:   <br>Photos: Jeff Allen  <br>Video/edit: Bert Beltran
