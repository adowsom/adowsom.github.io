Occurred on February 28, 2017 / Llanelli, South Wales, UK  <br>Info from Licensor: &quot;Here, I am riding in a small town, Llanelli, which is located in South Wales, the United Kingdom. An elderly driver pulls out on me, not realizing he has to give priority to the right. The tension then gets resolved by an apology and we continued on our way.&quot;
