IIT Bombay students received a virtual covocation on Sunday, August 23rd, and while the students could not be present at the ceremony their virtual avatars were presented with their degrees. This is the first time in the institute's 62-year history that awards and degrees were given away in virtual reality mode.   <br>#IITbombay #VirtualConvocation #Avatars
