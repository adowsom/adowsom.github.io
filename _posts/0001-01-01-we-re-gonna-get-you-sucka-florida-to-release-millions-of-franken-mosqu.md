Hundreds of millions of Franken-mosquitos will soon be released in Florida. Deliberately.  <br>The Florida Keys Mosquito Control District plans to release 750 million genetically engineered mosquitos, in the hopes of reducing another kind of mosquito.  <br>Aedes aegypti carries yellow fever, Zika, dengue, chikungunya, and other deadly diseases.  <br>According to Gizmodo, theyâ€™re the reason for the current outbreak of dengue fever in the Upper Keys, which has infected nearly 50 people.  <br>The genetically engineered mosquitos will be unable to produce female larvae that hatch and live long enough to spread disease.  <br>However, there are fears the scheme could simply produce mosquitoes more resistant to insecticide.  <br>Also, the impact of introducing hundreds of millions of tweaked mosquitoes into the ecosystem is unknown--and could be devastating.
