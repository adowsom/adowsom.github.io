Sushant Singh Rajput’s neighbor has made a shocking revelation about June 13, a day before the actor was found dead at his apartment. She claimed that she noticed suspicious activity in his residence. She revealed that on June 13, all the lights of the house were unusually switched-off around 10:30-10:45 pm at night. She added that all the lights except for the kitchen were switched-off. The neighbor also said that there was no party on June 13 at Sushant’s house. This is highly suspicious as there is a conspiracy theory that Sushant was probably killed at night. It is also reported that the crime scene has been highly compromised. The house was not sealed but instead returned to the landlord who removed the old furniture and made several changes to the house. They also handed over Sushant’s personal belongings to his family.
