Pakatan Harapan was only responsible for 5.3 percent of the directly awarded contracts worth RM6.6 billion mentioned by Finance Minister Tengku Zafrul Abdul Aziz yesterday.  <br>At a press conference at the Parliament lobby today, former finance minister Lim Guan Eng said most of the RM6.61 billion went to legacy projects (67.7 percent) and contracts for supplies or services (26.5 percent) taken on during the BN administration.  <br>He stressed that Harapan was only responsible for a fraction (0.07 percent) of the directly awarded contracts during its 22 months in power, which were mostly due to reasons that could not be avoided.
