Sheffield Wednesday have been in Loughborough this week and they're getting on like a bunch of students at freshers' week. So it is all looking positive in the Wednesday camp, with new found togetherness among the group and plenty of smiles on faces. Basking in the positivity, The Star's Owls writer Alex Miller flies solo this week as he joins Liam Hoden to reflect on Wednesday's pre-season camp. Alex discusses his chat with Kadeem Harris and why we could be seeing a renewed Jordan Rhodes. They talk the latest from the transfer window and look ahead to the friendly with Leicester City and a potential reunion with a certain son of a certain Owls legend.  <br>
