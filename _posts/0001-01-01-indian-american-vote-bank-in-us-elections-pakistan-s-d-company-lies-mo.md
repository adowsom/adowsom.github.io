The courtship is intense, and voter targeting specific. In this US presidential race, Indian Americans are no longer a monolith but a conglomeration of different religious identities.   <br>The evolution has been slow but sure and opinion is divided whether separation as Hindus, Muslims and Sikhs benefits the community as a whole or helps Indiaâ€™s case.
