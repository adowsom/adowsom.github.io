Embattled evangelical leader Jerry Falwell Jr. resigned Monday as president of Liberty University, the Christian school founded by his late father, a spokesman for the school told CNN.  <br>The Christian school in Lynchburg, Virginia, will issue a statement soon, Liberty University spokesman Scott Lamb said.  <br>The resignation of Falwell, one of President Trump's most prominent evangelical backers, comes after the latest in a series of recent public controversies about his behavior.  <br>A Miami man is saying he had an eight-year affair with Falwell Jr.'s wife after he met the couple at a Miami hotel. In a statement to CNN, Falwell Jr., acknowledged the affair.  <br>Falwell Jr., 58, who was on leave from the school, issued a lengthy statement Sunday saying he and his family were blackmailed by the man, who had an &quot;inappropriate personal relationship&quot; with his wife Becki.  <br>Jerry Falwell Jr. and his wife Becki Falwell speak during a town hall meeting on the opioid crisis in March 2019 in Las Vegas, Nevada.  <br>In his statement, obtained by CNN and first reported by the Washington Examiner, Falwell Jr. said the affair led to stress, weight loss and the feeling that he was &quot;living on a roller coaster.&quot;
