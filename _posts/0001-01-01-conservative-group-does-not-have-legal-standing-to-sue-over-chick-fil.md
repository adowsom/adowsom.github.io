A group of conservatives does not have the legal standing to sue the city of San Antonio.  <br>The group wanted to sue over the city's rejection of a Chick-fil-A restaurant at the cityâ€™s airport.  <br>The City Council approved a contract last year with an Atlanta-based company to bring new vendors to the Airport.  <br>The council however told it to strike Chick-fil-A and find another vendor, which upset the members of the conservative group.  <br>According to HuffPost, a Texas appeals court announced the ruling today.
