Welcome back guys to another let's play episode featuring the game, &quot;Among the Sleep&quot; enhanced edition.  <br>At the time I played this which was yesterday, I was stuck in the play pen for what felt like an eternity but I think it was more like 15 minutes or something?  I know, right?   <br>Some of you may be aware that I suck as a player so far.  I just started up this channel about 3 weeks ago and started off with the game, Amnesia, the dark descent?  As in, I just started gaming about three weeks ago.    <br>Well, I thought, why play just one?  Why not a dozen?  Ha!  Mmmkay...  <br>In the past three weeks I have purchased 22 horror games on Steam.  <br>And I plan on playing every one of them until I am perfect.  Seriously.  That's the plan.   <br>What do think?  Do you think I can do this?  Let's play and find out!  <br>Be safe everyone and hold your loved ones tight~!  <br>PEACE  <br>Oh, and I scare easily.  As soon as I start to panic, well, you'll see.  This is gonna be a fun trip.  For me at the very least.
