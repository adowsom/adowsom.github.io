Tanjong Karang MP Noh Omar appeared to have issues with some of the points raised by Bagan MP Lim Guan Eng when he was debating the Covid-19 financing bill in the Dewan Rakyat today.  <br>In his attempt to hit back at members of the previous Harapan government, Noh used a point frequently used by the opposition to criticise the Perikatan Nasional government, and thatâ€™s GLC appointments.  <br>What ensued was a chaotic shouting match in the House.
