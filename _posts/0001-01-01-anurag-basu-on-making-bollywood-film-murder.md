Bollywood director Anurag Basu on the making of 'Murder' with Emraan Hashmi and Mallika Sherawat. The director talks about the initial days of the film and the filming days. He talks about the characters in the film, the idea behind the bedroom scenes in the movie and the struggles to make a good movie, relationship between the actors and director. Anurag Basu: &quot;Basically the idea to make a film on real people was in Mukeshji's mind early on. Let's make a film about real people and let's bring out the bedroom to the people like that and just talk about inside story. So that was the basic story. Then the story took shape and you cannot pinpoint how the story took shape. It just takes shape and it was ready.&quot; Murder is a 2004 Indian Hindi erotic romantic thriller film, directed by Anurag Basu and produced by Mukesh Bhatt. It is the first installment in the Murder film series. It stars Emraan Hashmi, Ashmit Patel and Mallika Sherawat in the lead roles and is set in Bangkok, Thailand.
