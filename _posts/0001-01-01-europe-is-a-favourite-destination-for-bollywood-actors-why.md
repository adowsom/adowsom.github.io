Virat Kohli   Anushka Sharma had a picture-perfect Tuscany wedding. While Virat   Anushka looked gorgeous we can’t help but admire the exquisite villa in which they were married   that’s Borgo Finocchieto. One of the luxury villas in Tuscany, the Borgo is a beautifully   elegantly restored village with stunning views. It is composed of 5 villas which includes at least 22 suites   luxury rooms   can accommodate nearly 44 guests. There’s a private chef to cater to the guests’ needs, along with a concierge who arranges custom tours for the best of Borgo experiences. It also includes a 60-foot oval swimming pool and a fully equipped gym with weights. Like Borgo, Lake Como is another destination for celebrity weddings. While Deepika Padukone   Ranveer Singh got married at the upscale resort area Isha Ambani had her 3-day engagement party at the upscale location. Lake Como is set against the foothills of the gorgeous Alp ranges. The upside-down Y-shaped Laketown is home to renaissance architecture. Lake Como is surrounded by exquisite villas along its shoreline. A destination with such breath-taking views makes Lake Como the perfect terminus for any wedding.
