This is the incredible moment an ultra-rare albino crow is seen in Cuddalore, India on August 20.  <br>Selvam, the local animal activist, rushed to the spot where it was located and rescued the white bird. He said â€œit is an albino crow. We know that crows are black in color, but some of them are white too. The white-colored crow is also known as an albino. This white pigmentation happens due to genetic reasons or hormone deficiency. A rare genetic mutation resulting in a complete lack of color.&quot;  <br>Unfortunately, albino crows are rejected by their murder, or group, and get pecked and ostrachized.
