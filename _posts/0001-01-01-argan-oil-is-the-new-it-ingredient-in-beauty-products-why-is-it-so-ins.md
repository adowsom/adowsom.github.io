Twenty years ago, argan oil was sold by the side of road in Morocco for about $3 a gallon. International sales were virtually nonexistent.  <br>These days, argan oil can cost as much as $300 per liter, making it the world's most expensive edible oil.  <br>That's because the formation of women-run cooperatives has transformed the production into a billion-dollar industry.  <br>Argan oil is predominantly used in high-end cosmetic products and Moroccan cuisine.  <br>North Africans have been using the argan seeds for centuries, and Business Insider reports the methods for creating it haven't changed in years.  <br>Mostly produced by hand, the demand for the oil has made it unaffordable for most. That's led to the sale of adulterated oil, enhanced with chemicals.
