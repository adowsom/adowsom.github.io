Angelina Jolie says she is boring in real life. She added that her children are her creativity because she loves to watch each of them take on a unique personality. “Oh god, I’m really boring. I spend a lot of time studying foreign policy,” Jolie said while talking about how she is artsy outside of the acting world, during a special virtual press. “But I think my creativity is my kids. Because being with them and making up stories before bed or just being silly with them, I am really doing nothing. Just watching each of them become uniquely who they are and being around them and going into each of their space” In The One And Only Ivan, Jolie has voiced the character of an ageing elephant named Stella, who cares for an abandoned baby elephant named Ruby in a circus show at the Big Top Mall. The actress is also attached to the Disney movie as a producer. “One of my children read the book and said that they loved it. We talked about why it was special and why it meant so much to them. So, I started to pursue where it is being made, what’s happening and started to get involved. I looked at the early drafts and it was very interesting,” said the Oscar-winning star.
