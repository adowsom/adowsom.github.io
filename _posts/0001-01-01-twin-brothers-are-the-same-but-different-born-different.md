TWIN brothers Oliver and Harry are non-identical in more ways than one, but they don’t let their differences come in the way of their special bond. Oliver and Harry Beswick, aged 15, are fraternal twins from Stoke-On-Trent. The boys were born two months premature, weighing only three pounds each. Harry was born with Goldenhar Syndrome, a rare congenital defect which meant he was born with no features on the left-hand side of his face. Harry was also diagnosed with autism and has the functioning skills of a 4-year-old. Their mum, Charlie, told Truly: “The biggest thing my boys have taught me is there’s no such thing as perfect and imperfectly perfect is good enough.”
