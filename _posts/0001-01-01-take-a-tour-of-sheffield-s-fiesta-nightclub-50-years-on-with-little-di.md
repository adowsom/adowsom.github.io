It’s exactly 50 years this month since the Fiesta opened its doors, in August 1970.  <br>Over the next decade, some of the very biggest performers from across the globe would visit the Sheffield club, famous for its 1,300 seat amphitheatre and chicken-in-a-basket special.  <br>Stevie Wonder, The Beach Boys, Olivia Newton-John and the Jackson Five were among the big name musicians that enjoyed week-long residencies, as well as comedians including Les Dawson Tommy Cooper, and Bruce Forsythe.  <br>From her place on the reception desk in the club’s foyer, ‘Little Di’ - as she was known to many - would get the chance to meet them all.
