The ŠKODA OCTAVIA is the heart of the Czech car manufacturer and tops the bestseller lists in numerous European countries. In the fourth generation of the OCTAVIA, the robust SCOUT and two other sporty RS variants complete the portfolio. By electrifying the powertrain using the new mild hybrid technology and two OCTAVIA iV models with plug-in hybrid drives, ŠKODA once again significantly reduces the CO2 emissions of the new OCTAVIA. The bestseller's IV variants drive up to 60 kilometers locally without emissions in the WLTP cycle, and the internal combustion engines are also constantly being further developed. They are even more efficient and ŠKODA has reduced the emission of nitrogen oxides by around 80 percent in the diesel generators of the new EVO generation. With two body variants, front or all-wheel drive, manual gearbox or direct shift gearbox (DSG) and five drive options - petrol, diesel, CNG, mild and plug-in hybrid - every ŠKODA customer will find the right OCTAVIA. The heart of the all-wheel drive in the OCTAVIA is the electronically controlled multi-plate clutch, which, following the extensive technical revision in the current sixth generation, is also significantly lighter than its predecessor.
