Bailey, the dog, loved to go on adventures with her owner. She was flying on a plane with him, who was the pilot, while she sat on the back seat. He suddenly accelerated the plane downwards, and the dog experienced a negative g-force. She looked confused as she went up in the air and came down fast.
