Robert Scott Lazar is an American scientist who claimed to have worked on reverse engineering extraterrestrial technology at a site called S-4 near the Area 51 Groom Lake operating location. Lazar said that the UFOs use gravity wave propulsion and are powered by the (then unsynthesized) element 115. He said to have read US government briefing documents that describe alien involvement in human affairs over the past 10,000 years. Lazar's claims resulted in bringing the secret Area 51 site to the attention of the public.  <br>
