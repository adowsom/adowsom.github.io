Before Sushant ventured into films, he was a known face on television, thanks to his shows like Kis Desh Mein Hai Meraa Dil and Pavitra Rishta. Here is what some TV actors have to say about the latest development in the case: Mohit Malhotra, &quot;So finally it happened. It's a victory not just for Sushant's family, but for all those who stood up for him. With the Supreme Court ordering a CBI investigation, I feel now we will have a fair investigation and we will get to know what happened to him on that fateful day. Sushant's family can finally get some relief and hopefully they will get a closure soon too.&quot; Shashank Vyas, &quot;It was a much needed step and though it's just the first step towards justice, at least now we can expect an unbiased and fair investigation. I was always in favour of a CBI enquiry, but this goes to his fans, it is their victory.&quot; Kamya Punjabi, &quot;Buraai ki hui yeh pehli haar  bolo Ganapati Bappa Moryaa Jitega sach&quot; Rashami Desai, &quot;Sooner Or Later, Everyone Sits Down To A Banquet Of Consequences&quot;
