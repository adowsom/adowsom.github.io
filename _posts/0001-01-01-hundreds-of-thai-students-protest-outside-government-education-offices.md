Hundreds of Thai students protested against the country's government with a rally outside the Ministry of Education in Bangkok, Thailand, today (Aug 19).  <br>The High School youngsters are joining a growing movement of young people showing their anger at the military government who seized power with a coup in 2014.   <br>They are angry at teachers in many schools banning them from political expressions.  <br>A series of protests have taken place in recent months in which demonstrators - mainly university students and progressive groups - have called for greater levels of democracy and accountability in the country.   <br>On Saturday, thousands of protesters converged on the Democracy Monument in the capital Bangkok in the largest rally since 2014.  <br>Anger has been growing since March 2019 when controversial elections returned career soldier General Prayut Chan-o-cha to power and saw the progressive Future Forward Party disbanded amid claims that opposition parties were being silenced.  <br>A number of opposition leaders have been arrested in recent months though police so far shown restraint and have avoided any violent crackdowns on the gatherings.
