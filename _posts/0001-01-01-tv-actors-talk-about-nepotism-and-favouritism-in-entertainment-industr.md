It has been two months since Sushant Singh Rajput passed away, and his death has sparked a debate about nepotism and favouritism in showbiz. Weighing in on it are TV actor Sharad Malhotra says that favouritism, partiality, preference and prejudice exist everywhere and in all spheres, but these things should not hold people back or deter them from giving their best in life. “I honestly don’t know if I ever lost a role to favouritism but yes, there were times when just before signing on the dotted line, I was given a lame reason for the project not being worked out in my favour,” he shared. Naagin actor Jasmin Bhasin also feels that favouritism exists everywhere, even in friends’ circle, “In a group of five friends, there could be two friends who favour each other. Personally, yes, sometimes I have lost a role or a show but why tag that as favouritism? Maybe, I was not fulfilling the criteria. Why start the blame game? I believe in my talent and capability. If a role is meant for me, it will come to me.” While actor Shashank Vyas feels that more than anything else, it is destiny, “If something is written for you, then you will get it. I am not being philosophical but I truly believe in this. Nobody can make or break you. Whatever happens, it’s done by some energy. Also, I feel it totally depends on the person — how passionate or determined he or she is.” He agrees that favouritism exists in the television industry.
