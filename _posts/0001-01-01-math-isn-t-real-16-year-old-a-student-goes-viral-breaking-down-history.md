This is the viral video everyone can't stop talking about, and it's when 16-year-old Gracie Cunningham declares on Tiktok that &quot;math isn't real!&quot; while applying makeup on August 23.  <br>&quot;I don't think math is real. And I know it's real because we learn in school or whatever, but how? How did he come up with this? He didn't even have plumbing,&quot; Gracie said in the now-famous clip.     <br>Already racking up tens of millions of views on Twitter and TikTok, Gracie delivers a simply brilliant analysis of the history of math and asking where it all came from, down to what Pythagoras was thinking in her Virginia home.  <br>&quot;You didn't even need it, why did you come up with it?&quot; Gracie concludes.  <br>While some have dismissed her comments as &quot;dumb,&quot; many more have leaped to defend her inquisitive video as a provocative thought experiment.   <br>&quot;[The reaction was] a little positive, a little negative. Some people tried to really cancel me, which I was definitely upset about,&quot; said the 16-year-old who got an A in both geometry and algebra to Newsflare.  <br>&quot;I thought it through and I know that none of my videos had ill intentions. It’s weird cause I’m just like some kid and I don’t really know how to handle being a meme, you know what I mean? I’ve never had this much attention on me and now all these people are reaching out to me,&quot; said Gracie, who can be found @graciegcunning on Twitter.
