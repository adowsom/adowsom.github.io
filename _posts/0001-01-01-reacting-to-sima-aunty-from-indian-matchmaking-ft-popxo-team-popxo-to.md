It’s been almost a month since we got introduced to Netflix's latest show #IndianMatchmaking. But the words “Hi, I’m Sima from Mumbai” are still ringing in our ears and the comments from Sima Taparia, or Sima Aunty about how women need to adjust, compromise, and behave if they ever wanted to get married are still making us cringe. In today's episode of POPxo To Be Honest, watch how did team #POPxo respond to the 'not so needed' advice shared by Sima Aunty on the show.
