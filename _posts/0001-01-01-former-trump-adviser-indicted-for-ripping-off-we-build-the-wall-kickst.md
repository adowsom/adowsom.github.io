Steve Bannon used to be a White House adviser to US President Donald J. Trump until he got fired in 2017.  <br>Since then, Bannon, Brian Kolfage, and others carried on working towards Trump's campaign promise to build a wall on the US-Mexico border.  <br>They started a Kickstarter campaign called 'We Build the Wall,' which raised millions of dollars in donations.  <br>But now, Bannon and others in his group are in serious legal trouble. According to Newser, Bannon was indicted in federal court on Thursday.  <br>Bannon's been charged for defrauding donors. Despite pledging to take no salary, Bannon received $1 million and Kolfage more than $350,000 from the fund.  <br>The pair allegedly routed the money through shell companies to conceal their personal payments.
