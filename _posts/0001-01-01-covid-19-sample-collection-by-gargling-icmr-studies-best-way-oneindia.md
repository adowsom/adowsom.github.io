A study by the Indian Council of Medical Research has revealed that lavage from gargling could be used to test for the SARS-CoV-2 virus instead of taking nasal or throat swabs. The study conducted by ICMR sought to find out whether gargling lavage could act as an alternative to swabs for the detection of the Covid 19-causing virus. It also sought to assess the patient's acceptability to the 2 sampling methods.  <br>#Covid19 #CovidTesting #ICMR
