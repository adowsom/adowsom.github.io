A guest who attended Robert Trump's funeral party got upset Friday night, and took it out on a restaurant worker at Washington, D.C.'s Fig &amp; Olive restaurant.  <br>According to Newser, the unnamed guest punched the Fig &amp; Olive restaurant worker in the nose.  <br>NBC News correspondent Geoff Bennett confirmed the incident by tweet, saying the mourner 'blindsided one of my servers.'  <br>Pandemic restrictions limited guests to six per tableâ€”which meant a four-table party.  <br>However, things got heated when restaurant management was forced to refuse entry to some late arrivals. No one has been arrested.
