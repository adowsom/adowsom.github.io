Lori Loughlin is headed to prison. The former &quot;Full House&quot; star was sentenced to two months behind bars for her role in the college admissions scandal, Access Hollywood confirmed on Friday. In addition, the actress must pay a $150,000 fine, complete 100 hours of community service and be under two years' supervised release. The latest development for the 56-year-old's legal saga comes just hours after her husband, Mossimo Giannulli, received a five-month sentence and orders to pay a $250,000 fine and serve 250 hours of community service. In May, the couple pleaded guilty to respective conspiracy and fraud charges stemming from allegations they paid $500,000 to have their daughters admitted to USC as recruits for the crew team, despite neither girl having ever participated in the sport.
