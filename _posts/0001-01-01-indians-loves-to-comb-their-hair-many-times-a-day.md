Join us as we go Man-watching at a bus stop in India, Desmond Morris-esque! People wait at a bus-stop. One man taps and shuffles his feet impatiently. Another drinks tea while a third combs his hair. Indians just LOVE to comb their hair ANY time of day and MANY times over! They seem to always be on the look-out for a mirror to see their faces in - a motorcycle mirror often works, sometimes a reflection in a shop window and at other times - even a puddle of rainwater on the ground! This footage is part of the professionally-shot broadcast stock footage archive of Wilderness Films India Ltd., the largest collection of HD imagery from South Asia.
