As Joe Biden formally accepted his nomination for president, he vowed to end the 'season of darkness' and offers hope as he looks to unite all Americans while warning that President Donald Trump would go on stoking hatred and fear if elected to another four-year term.  <br>Former Vice President Joe Biden says if he wins the presidency in November, the first thing he would do as president is implement his national strategy to combat coronavirus.  <br>Donald Trump accused Biden of spouting empty words as Joe ripped him as a &quot;divisive&quot; president in his Democratic nomination acceptance speech.  <br>Biden accepted the blue party's nomination for president on Thursday at the Democratic National Convention.  <br>s Biden slammed Trump as being &quot;divisive&quot; in his acceptance speech, the president hit at the former Vice President on Twitter.  <br>&quot;In 47 years, Joe did none of the things of which he now speaks,&quot; Trump tweeted.  <br>&quot;He will never change, just words!&quot;  <br>In his acceptance speech from Wilmington, Delaware, Biden quoted civil rights activist Ella Baker, saying: &quot;Five people light and they will find a way.&quot;  <br>&quot;Give people light. Those are words for our time,&quot; Biden said.
