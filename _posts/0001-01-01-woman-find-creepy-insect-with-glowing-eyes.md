A mysterious insect with creepy glowing eyes entered a woman's bedroom in French Guiana recently.  <br>Insect enthusiast Lo Bov said the strange beetle flew through the open window of her house in Amazonia on August 4th.  <br>She said: &quot;We live close to the forest in an open house. We thought it was just because of the lamp light, but it still glows even with lights off.&quot;  <br>Lo added that the insect was immediately released back into their garden.
