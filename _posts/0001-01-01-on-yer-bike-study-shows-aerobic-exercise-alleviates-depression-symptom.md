For some young adults suffering from depression, happiness might be just a pair of sneakers away.  <br>According to UPI, a new study shows moderate-intensity aerobic exercise can be an effective treatment for some young adults with depression.  <br>Participants who worked out on a treadmill or exercise bike, three times a week for 45 minutes per session, for eight weeks, saw a 55% drop in symptoms.  <br>Those who did light-intensity stretching routines three times per week, for forty-five minutes, for eight weeks saw a 31% reduction in their symptoms.  <br>The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says up to 8% of Americans 12 years old and older experience symptoms of depression.  <br>For some, medication is ineffective in treating depression. On the other hand, the study authors said exercise should not be seen as a cure-all.
