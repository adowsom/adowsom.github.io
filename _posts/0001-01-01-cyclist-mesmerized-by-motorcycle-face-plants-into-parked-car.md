Occurred on July 3, 2020 / Napa, California, USA  <br>Info from Licensor: &quot;I was just cruising and having some fresh air in the neighborhood because that's what I do best and this happened. They’ve seen me once before this video because I was hanging out by my car and motorcycle. I was cleaning both of them and they waved at me, probably just saying hi because I live in a nice neighborhood where people are usually friendly. As I was cruising in the neighborhood, one of the young ladies said something but couldn’t hear her because I had my helmet and earplugs on. I slowed down and turned on my go pro at that moment. Then the unfortunate accident happened. She notified the owner of the car and knocked at their door to inform them of the small damage to their car. Good thing it wasn't the BMW M5 that was hit.&quot;
