Satellite imagery analysis by artificial intelligence platform MioTech shows how China's worst floods in decades have damaged the country. Intense rainfall and severe flooding has battered China since early June 2020. The natural disaster has left more than 4,000 people dead and 14 million homeless. It has also tested the strength of the Three Gorges Dam, which spans the Yangtze River.  Credit: MioTech Inc in Hong Kong
