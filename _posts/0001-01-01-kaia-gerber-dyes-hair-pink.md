Though Kaia Gerber just bleached her light brown hair on August 15, that apparently wasn't the end of the model's color journey. With the help of hairstylist Guido Palau, she's transformed her bleach-blonde hair into a cute pink ombré less than a week later. &quot;You know, I’ve never dyed my hair,&quot; Gerber tells Palau before getting started. She begins by sectioning the top half of her slightly damp blonde bob with a hair clip and putting on a towel and black jacket to prevent the dye from staining her clothes.
