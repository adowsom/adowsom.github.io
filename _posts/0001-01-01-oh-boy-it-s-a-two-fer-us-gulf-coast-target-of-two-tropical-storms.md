Amid the stormy weather of the political landscape, Gulf Coast residents need to pay close attention to the actual weather in the coming days.  <br>That's because not one, but two tropical systems could make landfall in the coming days.  <br>CNN reports the first system to watch out for is Tropical Storm Laura, which is currently making its way over Puerto Rico.  <br>It's expected to move northwest toward Hispaniola and Cuba over the next few days.  <br>Tropical Storm Marco is just east of the Yucatan Peninsula in Mexico. It's expected to dump several inches of rain before continuing north toward the US.  <br>CNN meteorologist Dave Hennen says it's unknown which storm will be the strongest--particularly if the two storms meet and interact with each other.
