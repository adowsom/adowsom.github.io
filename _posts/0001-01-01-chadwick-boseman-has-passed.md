'Black Panther' fans are in shock from the announcement of the death of Chadwick Boseman. He was 43.  <br>According to CNN, Boseman died after a four year battle with colon cancer.  <br>Boseman made a career of playing real-life Black historical figures including Jackie Robinson, James Brown, and Thurgood Marshall.  <br>But as T'Challa/Black Panther, Boseman was grace personified as the leader of Wakanda.  <br>In a Twitter statement released on his account announcing Boseman's death, it was noted that his 'Black Panther' role was the 'honor of his career.'  <br>The public was unaware that Boseman was displaying some heroism of his own as he had been diagnosed with stage III colon cancer in 2016.  <br>Despite his illness, Boseman still chose to continue in not only 'Black Panther,' but also playing the role in 'Avengers: Infinity War' and 'Avengers: Endgame.'
