Hyundai Motor is launching comprehensive connectivity and design enhancements for the new IONIQ, the latest edition of its revolutionary eco-friendly model. As of its launch in 2016, IONIQ was the world's first car planned from the start to offer three electrified powertrains - hybrid, plug-in hybrid and full electric. The Hyundai IONIQ is now already upgrading its offer, with added technological features and a refreshed look. Hyundai keeps leading the way in future mobility, as many other manufacturers are still planning or just launching their first eco-mobility vehicles.  <br>The new IONIQ features advanced Blue Link connectivity services, SmartSense active safety and driving assistance systems and state-of-the-art infotainment features. In addition, both the exterior and interior design receive updates, while drivers of the new IONIQ Electric can also enjoy 36% added energy capacity thanks to an upgraded 38.3-kWh battery.
