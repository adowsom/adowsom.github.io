Real eiderdown is one of the warmest natural fibers you can find, but it doesn't come cheap. And an eiderdown double duvet could cost you over $8,000. Harvested from the nest of eider ducks found wild in Iceland, collecting a kilo of this fluffy material isn't easy, and only 4 metric tons are produced worldwide each year. So what makes eiderdown so expensive?
