Rhea Chakraborty, partner of deceased actor Sushant Singh Rajput left the DRDO guest house in Mumbai's Santacruz east at around 7.30 pm on Sunday. It is at the same guest house that a team of the Central Bureau of Intelligence (CBI) has been questioning Rhea for the past three days in connection with Rajput's death. The Mumbai Police have taken it upon themselves to escort Rhea's vehicle to and from her residence after she complained of harassment by the paparazzi. Chakraborty has been photographed travelling in a grey Innova these past few days. The car (MH 02 FE 1663) is registered to one Mithun Gole. Not many details are available about Gole except that he seems to be the second owner of the Innova car that was initially registered in 2014.
