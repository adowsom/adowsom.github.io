An Israeli jeweller is working on what is described as the “world’s most expensive” coronavirus mask, a face covering that comes with plenty of gold and diamonds and a price tag of US$1.5 million. The mask maker has declined to identify the buyer, other than to say he is a Chinese businessman living in the United States.
