A restaurant chain's campaign to curb food wastage in China has backfired horribly.  <br>According to CNN, popular Hunan chain Chuiyan Fried Beef has issued a public apology for weighing diners before they entered.  <br>After patrons were weighed, they were given suggestions for dishes based on their weight and the food's calorie content, based on their physique.  <br>Signs around the restaurant encouraged diners to 'clean your plate' and &quot;be thrifty and diligent.'  <br>Facing online accusations of fat-shaming, Chuiyan Fried Beef said Saturday it would still allow customers to weigh themselves at its outlets.
