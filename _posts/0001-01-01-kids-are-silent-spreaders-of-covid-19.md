It is believed that children may be less likely than adults to become severely sick with COVID-19.  <br>However, mounting evidence shows they may be major silent spreaders of the virus.  <br>A study published this week in the Journal of Pediatrics looked at nearly 200 children.  <br>All came to urgent care clinics or hospitals with suspected COVID-19, reports HuffPost.  <br>Almost 50 of them tested positive but most of the children were not particularly ill.  <br>Only about half who tested positive for had a fever, for example.  <br>Many had no symptoms, but had been in contact with someone who had the virus.
