India’s Best Dancer celebrated Azadi special to mark the occasion of Independence Day and welcomed Sonu Sood, who has become the messiah of migrants and helped people across the country with his noble gestures. The episode featured various acts by contestants depicting different concepts, which were all lauded by the actor, who even became emotional on seeing some performances. Everyone appreciated and saluted Sonu Sood’s kind gestures in difficult times and the actor even shared anecdotes about his journey and experiences in the past four months. The episode was the plethora of sweet moments, and heart-touching incidents narrated by the actor. On a lighter note, in the episode we saw Sonu and Malaika set the stage on fire with their performance on Munni Badnaam Hui. Bharti quizzed them about the song and then requested Sonu and Malaika to dance together. The two stars obliged graciously and shook a leg on their famous track and captivated everyone around with their sizzling moves. Walking down memory lane, Sonu shared, “It was not just a memorable song in the film, but we also performed on this song across different countries such as America and Canada.” Malaika added, “We did a world tour and performed on this track.”
