Facebook's &quot;classic&quot; experience, the interface with the iconic blue navigation bar at the top, is disappearing for good in September. According to The Verge, Engadget reported that a Facebook support page has been updated and everyone will soon have the new design. Although users can temporarily switch back to the old interface on Facebook's site, the button that warns &quot;the classic Facebook will no longer be available starting in September.&quot; The new interface was announced at Facebook's developer conference last year and initially rolled out on the service's iOS and Android apps. In March, it got a widespread release on desktop, as an opt-in feature, leaving people free to continue using the old design if they want to. However, in September, the old design will disappear.  <br>
