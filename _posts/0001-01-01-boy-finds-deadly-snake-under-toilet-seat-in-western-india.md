A 10-year-old boy found a deadly common krait snake under his apartment's toilet seat in Pune, western India on August 12.  <br>He saw something moving under his weight and when he looked down, he saw a snake right under the seat and ran out in fright.   <br>When his parents checked, they failed to see anything but made a call to snake rescuer Saidas Kusal.  <br>Kusal found the common krait snake, which was 3.5 feet long, hiding underneath the toilet seat.  <br>A colleague of Saidas caught the snake by its tail and put it in a bag, which was later released in the wild.   <br>Saidas said: “The snake was barely visible, it refused to come out even when I flushed. Common kraits, one of the most venomous snakes in India, are responsible for many deaths. The family did have a lucky escape.”
