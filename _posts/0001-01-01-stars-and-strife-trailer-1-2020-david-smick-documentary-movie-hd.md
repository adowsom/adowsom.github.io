A documentary about how an epidemic of hatred has left America helpless in the face of crisis. A common-sense majority is exhausted and eager for solutions. But they’re up against a hate industry devoted to contempt and division. Our politics value opponents’ demise over dialogue — and our elected officials put party over country. A remarkable cast includes a civil rights leader, the former heir apparent to the white nationalist movement, and former cabinet secretaries of both parties. Together, they explore why, to meet the challenges of our time and live up to the promises of our founding, we need to correct course. When we come together, Americans can build a main street economy that expands opportunity and a practical politics that brings results. Most of all, we can rediscover empathy — the lost heart of our country.
