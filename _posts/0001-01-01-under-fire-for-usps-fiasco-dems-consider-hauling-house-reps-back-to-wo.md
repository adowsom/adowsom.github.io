Democrats may bring the House of Representatives back as early as next week to discuss some of the issues facing the United States Postal Service.  <br>House members are being roundly criticized in their districts during this recess period for not coming back and trying to do something about this postal issue.  <br>CNN reports the possibility arises amid the run-up to the 2020 presidential election in November.  <br>Many voters across the US are expected to vote by mail because of the novel coronavirus COVID-19 pandemic.  <br>The USPS has removed letter collection boxes in at least four states: New York, Oregon, Montana, and Indiana.  <br>Representatives at the USPS's national headquarters have still been unable to confirm whether they would stop removing letter collection boxes.
