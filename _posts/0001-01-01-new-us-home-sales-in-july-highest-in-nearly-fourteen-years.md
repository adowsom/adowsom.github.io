Despite record unemployment, July sales of new homes in the US have hit the highest rate in nearly fourteen years.  <br>Sales jumped the most in the Midwest, soaring 58.8% to 127,000 units. Home sales shrank in the Northeast by 23.1% to 40,000 units.  <br>The price for homes is higher, too. According to Markets Insider, median sales price gained 7.2% to $330,600 from the year-ago period.  <br>The summer boom was propelled mainly by record low interest rates and a lack of listings for existing homes.  <br>However, Oxford Economics says the pace is likely unsustainable.  <br>While strong demand and lower mortgage rates are supportive of further growth in sales, the slow recovery and weak labor market pose downside risks.
