벨라루스 수십만 퇴진 시위에…루카셴코 &quot;권력 나눌 수 있어&quot;  <br>It's time now for our Tuesday's edition of Arirang's 'The World Now'. I'm Kim Jae-hee.   <br>Belarus' embattled president says he would be willing to share power and change the constitution,... but won't do so while he's under pressure from protests.  <br>Alexander Lukashenko, a man labelled by some as the &quot;last dictator in Europe&quot;,... made the comments on Monday, saying work was already under way on possible changes to the constitution, that could redistribute power.   <br>But he made it clear the offer would not be delivered on while he's under pressure from protesters.  <br>&quot;A president should not make decisions as a result of pressure.&quot;  <br>His remarks come as large-scale protests continue against the results of the presidential election that extended Lukashenko's 26-year rule.  <br>The main opposition party claims the results that gave him more than 80 percent of the votes were rigged.  <br>EU leaders will hold an emergency meeting on Wednesday to discuss their response to the protests, which could include sanctions.   <br>NATO also says it's closely monitoring the situation in Belarus.    <br>
