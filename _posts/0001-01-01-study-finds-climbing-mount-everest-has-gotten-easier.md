Climbing Mount Everest is one of the hardest athletic feats a person can do.  <br>But new research out this week suggests that it has gotten easier to pull off in recent years.  <br>The study found the success rate of climbing the highest mountain on Earth has doubled.  <br>About 2/3 of climbers during 2006 to 2019 reached the summit and survived.  <br>But the probability of dying has remained essentially constant, at about 1%,”.  <br>From 1990 to 2005, the rate of success was around one-third.
