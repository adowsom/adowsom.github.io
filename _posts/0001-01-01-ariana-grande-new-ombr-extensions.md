Celebrities going blonde is something that, at this point, happens on a daily basis. We get it — being cooped up in your house for months will make you want to make a dramatic hair transformation. Recently, we saw Kylie Jenner go blonde (it was a wig, but still), Joe Jonas became a blond (and a dad), and now Ariana Grande is a blonde, too. The singer is known for her insanely good vocals, but in the beauty world, we know her for her long, thick, extensions — specifically her iconic ponytail.
