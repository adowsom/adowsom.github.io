One of the strongest hurricanes ever to strike the U.S. has made landfall.  <br>Hurricane Laura barreled across Louisiana on Thursday, reports HuffPost.  <br>Laura sheared off roofs, killing a least four people and maintaining ferocious strength.  <br>It has carved a destructive path hundreds of miles inland.  <br>A full assessment of the damage wrought by the Category 4 system was likely to take days.  <br>Entire neighborhoods are in ruins and more than 875,000 people are without power.
