As the race for a COVID-19 vaccine rages on, Bangladesh's leading pharma company Beximco has announced it will be investing in Adar Poonawalla's Serum India Limited for development of the vaccine.  The deal is designed to ensure that Bangladesh is among the first countries to receive an agreed quantity of this vaccine from Serum India Limited on a priority basis. The investment will be treated as an advance for the vaccine.
