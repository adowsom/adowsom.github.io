This is the weird moment plastic barriers blew into the road blocking traffic and leaving drivers bemused.   <br>The orange barriers were installed in Mandaluyong City in Manila in the Philippines to help with traffic flow.   <br>But during windy weather they repeatedly blew away blocking oncoming cars.   <br>Driver John Rex Rebuyas Torrijos said: ''I think traffic enforcers need to review how effective these are.''
