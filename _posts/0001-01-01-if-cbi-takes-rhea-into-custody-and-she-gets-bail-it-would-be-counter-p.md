While speaking to media in the national capital on August 27, the lawyer of Sushant Singh Rajput's father, Vikas Singh said, “If the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) takes her (Rhea Chakraborty) into custody without any hard evidence and she gets bail, then the entire exercise would be counter-productive.”
