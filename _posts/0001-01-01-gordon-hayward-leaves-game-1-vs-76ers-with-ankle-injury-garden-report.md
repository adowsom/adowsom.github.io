Gordon Hayward Leaves Game 1 vs 76ers With Ankle Injury | Garden Report  <br>The wet blanket on the Boston Celtics' Game 1 win against the Philadelphia 76ers was Gordon Hayward's fourth-quarter injury. Hayward suffered a right ankle sprain that took him out of the game; he was later seen leaving the facility on crutches and in a boot. While it's not the same ankle that he broke against Cleveland in 2017, it comes as Hayward was hitting his stride heading into the postseason.  <br>Hayward will receive an MRI on Monday night and there is not yet a timeline on his return. Sierra Goodwill, Jimmy Toscano and Josue Pavon discuss how major of a loss this would be for the Celtics.  <br>The CLNS Media Network is the leading provider for video/audio content.
