The US intelligence community has not yet been able to tap into all sources of information on the origins of the novel coronavirus COVID-19.  <br>However, CNN reports intelligence officials say officials in Wuhan, China, kept the top brass in Beijing none the wiser for weeks.  <br>US intelligence reports say that when the Chinese Communist Party learned about the virus, it tried to keep most of that knowledge from the rest of the world.  <br>US officials say the Chinese conduct fits a pattern that was also seen during the outbreak of SARS, or severe acute respiratory syndrome, in 2003.  <br>The Trump administration has looked into the possibility that the novel coronavirus spread from a Chinese laboratory rather than a market.  <br>However, it has presented no proof to back up that theory.
