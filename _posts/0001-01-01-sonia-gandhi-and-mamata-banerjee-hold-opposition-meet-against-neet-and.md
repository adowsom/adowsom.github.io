Congress president Sonia Gandhi on Wednesday convened a meeting with the chief ministers of seven states regarding the Joint Entrance Examination (JEE)-Main and NEET which are due to be conducted in September. Sonia Gandhi termed the New Education Policy as a set back for progressive, secular and scientific values. During the virtual meeting, West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee suggested approaching the Supreme Court again for postponing the exams owing to the prevailing Covid-19 situation. She said state governments were being bulldozed by the centre in the name of cooperative federalism. Mamata Banerjee also referred to the two letters she wrote to Prime Minister Narendra Modi earlier in the week seeking postponement on the entrance exams.
