&quot;The New Mutants&quot; is a movie spun out of the &quot;X-Men&quot; franchise.  <br>CNN reports that the film has followed a long-delayed, tortured path to the screen.  <br>The film is hitting theaters without much support or fanfare.  <br>There are also no advanced reviews.  <br>The horror-tinged movie won't be screened in advance for critics as it lands in theaters Friday.  <br>Some press outlets have sought to explain to readers why they won't be reviewing &quot;New Mutants.&quot;  <br>Media outlets said Disney's failure to provide at-home screener links or in-person options.
