Archaeologists have discovered these polished tools and clay statues of a fertility cult from an ancient European civilisation who lived 6,500 years ago. The discoveries were made at an archaeological site in Topolita village in the commune of Grumazesti in north-eastern Romania’s Neamt County where the Pre-Cucuteni culture lived. Dr Vasile Diaconu, from the Neamt National Museum Complex, who is leading the archaeological team, told Real Press that the discoveries included “numerous prehistoric objects” such as “carved and polished stone tools, bone tools, but also splendid anthropomorphic representations”. He added: “The latter are modelled from clay in a very realistic way, with meticulous anatomical details. Most experts say that all these human statuettes, mainly female characters, are the expression of a fertility cult, common to most sedentary prehistoric communities, who practised agriculture.”  <br>
