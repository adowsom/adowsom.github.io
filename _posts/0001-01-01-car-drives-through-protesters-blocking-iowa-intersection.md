Occurred on August 21, 2020 / Iowa City, Iowa, USA  <br>Info from Licensor: &quot;I was just watching the BLM protests as they went down the street. The protesters had blocked an intersection when I noticed that a guy was acting unusually as he spun the wheels while taking off aggressively after turning around. I'm glad I caught it on video. When he went through the crowd I was shocked. I couldnâ€™t believe someone would do that. It seemed like a deliberate attack. Luckily no one was injured.&quot;
