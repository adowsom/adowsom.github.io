This summer is set to see clubs think outside the box to rebuild their squads on the cheap - but that makes it one of the riskiest windows in years. On today’s 10, we cover Liverpool’s capture of Kostas Tsimikas, Man United’s pursuit of Ousmane Dembele, and Man City’s signing of Nathan Ake, and ask whether those players can measure up to expectation. We also look at Gabriel, who attracted interest from Napoli and Arsenal, as well as Wilf Zaha’s public interest in a switch, and whether Frank Lampard can keep Chelsea’s youngsters happy following the moves for Werner, Ziyech, and Havertz. Finally, we examine the situation at Barcelona and ask what can the club afford less: to sell Messi, or to keep him?
