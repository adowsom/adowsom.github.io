On Thursday night, President Donald Trump accepted the Republican presidential nomination for a second term.  <br>Just 24 hours earlier he tried to say exactly what he would do with another four years.  <br>The President has repeatedly struggled to articulate why he wants a second term.  <br>During multiple media appearances, Trump's answer to the question has been &quot;unintelligible&quot; at best and &quot;incomprehensible&quot; at worst.  <br>CNN says the lack of a second term plan is just typical Trump.  <br>&quot;Trump is, and has always been, far more reactive than proactive.&quot;
