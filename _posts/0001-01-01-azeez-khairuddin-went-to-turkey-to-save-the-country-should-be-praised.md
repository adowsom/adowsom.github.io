Baling MP Abdul Azeez Abdul Rahim told Dewan Rakyat today that Plantation Industries and Commodities Minister Khairuddin Aman Razali should be praised for traveling to Turkey during the pandemic to 'save the country', instead of being ridiculed for flouting the mandatory Covid-19 quarantine.  <br>Azeez alleged that former prime minister Dr Mahathir Mohamad had fought with many countries, and  Khairuddin went to Turkey to mend ties with the country.  <br>Khairuddin was supposed to have undergone home quarantine after returning from Turkey on July 7 but was spotted at several events including having attended Parliament on July 13.
