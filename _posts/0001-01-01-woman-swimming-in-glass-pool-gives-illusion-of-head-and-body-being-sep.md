This woman was enjoying a swim in a glass pool outdoors. Due to the refraction phenomenon, it looked as if her head, which was above the water surface and her the rest of her body underwater, were separate. She was giving the illusion of being headless until she came up to the edge to reveal it was an optical illusion.  <br>*The underlying music rights are not available for license.
