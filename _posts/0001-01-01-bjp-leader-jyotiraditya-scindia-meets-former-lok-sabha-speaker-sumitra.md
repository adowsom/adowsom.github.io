Bharatiya Janata Party leader Jyotiraditya Scindia met former Lok Sabha speaker Sumitra Mahajan on August 17. Both leaders met at the latter's residence in Indore. Later reacting on Digvijaya Singh’s tweet where he said, water of Chambal hates Traitors, Jyotiraditya Scindia said, “He has the full freedom to say whatever he wants, in the end there is only one god and that is the people. They will decide who is real and fake.”
