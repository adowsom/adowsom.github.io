Former finance minister Lim Guan Eng today challenged his successor to reveal all government projects which were dished out through a direct negotiation process during the BN era and the current Perikatan Nasional (PN) administration.  <br>This came after Tengku Zafrul Abdul Aziz released a list of 101 direct tender projects worth RM6.61 billion, which he alleged were approved by the Pakatan Harapan government when Lim was the minister in charge of finance.
