Lawyers for President Donald Trump are scrambling to figure out how to prevent the financial records of their client from being subpoenaed.  <br>CNN reports Trump's lawyers filed an emergency request Friday for a federal appeals court to put a subpoena for his financial documents and tax returns on hold.  <br>It's Trump's latest attempt to block prosecutors from gaining his financial records and tax returns from his long-time accountant Mazars USA.  <br>US District Judge Victor Marrero denied Trump's request to put his decision dismissing the lawsuit on hold to allow the President's legal team time to appeal.  <br>Trump's lawyers told the 2nd US Circuit Court of Appeals that a refusal of a stay would result in 'quintessential irreparable harm.'
