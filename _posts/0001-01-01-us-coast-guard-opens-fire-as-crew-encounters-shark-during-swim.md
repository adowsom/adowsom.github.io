The US Coast Guard Cutter Kimball opened fire when a shark approached its crew members during a swim call in the Pacific Ocean on August 20, 2020. About 40 crew members were swimming when the shark was spotted. The creature, estimated to be 1.8 to 2.4 metres long, appeared to be uninjured as it swam away.
