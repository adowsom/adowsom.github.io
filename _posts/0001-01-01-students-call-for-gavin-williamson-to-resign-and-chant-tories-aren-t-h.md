Students gathered outside the Department for Education in London on Saturday (August 22) calling for the resignation of Education Secretary Gavin Williamson following the algorithm fiasco with this year's A-Level results.  <br>The algorithm - which looked at mock exam results and a school's track record - lowered the results of nearly 40% of students who could not take exams due to the coronavirus pandemic. Grades awarded by the algorithm have since been withdrawn and Williamson has apologised.  <br>Despite the U-turn, students still protested outside the department, calling for Williamson's resignation and chanting &quot;Tories aren't human.&quot;
