Former MACC chief Mohamad Shukri Abdull denied claims that the commission’s detention facilities are haunted.  <br>He said this in response to former Felda chairperson Mohd Isa Abdul Samad’s testimony at the Kuala Lumpur High Court on Monday.  <br>Shukri said he has never heard of such stories regarding the lockup in his over 30 years of service with the MACC and its predecessor the Anti-Corruption Agency.  <br>On Monday, Isa claimed that his former special political officer Muhammad Zahid Md Arip had implicated him in corruption allegations totalling RM3 million to avoid being charged.  <br>He said Zahid told him he was forced to do so under duress after being harassed by a “ghost” in the MACC lockup.
