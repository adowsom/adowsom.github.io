Sushant Singh Rajput’s Pavitra Rishta co-star Usha Nadkarni, Parag Tyagi and Ankita Lokhande welcomed the Supreme Court ruling that ordered a CBI probe in the death of the late actor on Wednesday. Veteran star Usha Nadkarni is very much delighted by the news, she says, &quot;I feel so happy that now CBI will look into the case. People have prayed so much and now their prayers have been answered. A lot of what has happened in the aftermath of Sushant's death has been chaotic. I really feel he deserves justice. Lekin CBI me jaake bhi kya hoga maaloom nahi. Log CBI CBI kar rahe hain. Ab sab bhagwan bharose hai.” Parag says it is the first step towards real justice and hopes that the truth behind the late actor's death comes out soon, &quot;CBI enquiry is necessary. Somewhere there is a catch, Sushant was a very strong man. I knew him very well. His fans, family have the right to know the truth. They deserve to know the truth. Now with the CBI enquiry.&quot; While Ankita took to social media to express her happiness at the decision of the apex court, she wrote, &quot;Justice is the truth in action. Truth wins .... #1ststeptossrjustice,&quot;
