The Supreme Court has said the government hadn’t addressed the “plight of the people due to the lockdown” and was only “interested in business” as it had failed to take a stand on waiving interest during the six-month loan moratorium that’s to end on August 31.  <br>The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) had announced the halt on repayments to support borrowers hit by the Covid-19 pandemic and the lockdown that followed but has said that interest won’t be waived. The Supreme Court is hearing a plea seeking the waiver of interest during the moratorium period.  <br>#SupremeCourt #COVID19 #RBI #Lockdown #EMIs
