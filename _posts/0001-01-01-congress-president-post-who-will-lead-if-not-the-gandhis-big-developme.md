The Indian National Congress is faced with the old dilemma again - If not Gandhis, then who? As senior party leaders register open dissent  against Gandhis, some loyalists think it is only the Gandhis who can keep the Congress together. But, Sonia Gandhi has conveyed her resolve to step down as interim president and urged tha party to look for a non-Gandhi leader. Will Gandhis appoint a proxy? Or will there be a unanimous resolution asking Sonia to stay on?  <br>#Congress #leadership #SoniaGandhi
