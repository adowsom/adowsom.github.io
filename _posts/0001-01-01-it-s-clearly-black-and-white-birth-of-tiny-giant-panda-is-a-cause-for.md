Hooray, giant Chinese panda Mei Xiang is a new mommy!  <br>According to HuffPost, Mei Xiang gave birth to her tiny bundle of joy Friday, at the Smithsonian National Zoo.  <br>The zoo said in a statement that Mei Xiang is 'caring for her newborn attentively' and is 'exhibiting positive mothering behavior,' like cuddling and nursing her cub.  <br>In a tweet, the zoo said it caught a glimpse of 'the wonderful, wiggly cub' and heard it squeak.  <br>Female pandas are able to become pregnant for only 24 to 72 hours each year. Mei Xiang was artificially inseminated in March.  <br>The sex of the cub will be determined when vets examine it in a few days. Welcome, baby panda!
