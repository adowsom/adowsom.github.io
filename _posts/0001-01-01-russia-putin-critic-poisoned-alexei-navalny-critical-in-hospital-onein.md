Russian opposition politician Alexei Navalny was admitted in a critical condition to a hospital after suspected poisoning according to his spokesperson. 44-year-old Navalny is unconscious, in intensive care and on an artificial lung ventilator. His spokeswoman Kira Yarmysh suspects deliberate poisoning, with something mixed in his tea as that was all he drank in the morning. Navalny is a fierce critic of Russian President Vladimir Putin and has been jailed several times for organising anti-Kremlin protests.   <br>#AlexeiNavalny #VladimirPutin #poisoning
