The National Association of Business Economists on Monday presented a decidedly gloomy assessment of the US economy.  <br>Based on its August survey, NABE says America remains in a deep downturn and is running a serious risk of a worsening recession lasting at least another year.  <br>CNN reports about half of the organization's members expect that the US gross domestic product won't return to its pre-pandemic level until 2022.  <br>CNN reports nearly 80% say there is a one-in-four chance of a double-dip recession. More than half say unemployment benefits should be extended.  <br>As for the US federal government's massive, unprecedented stimulus program? 40% of NABE members say the government hasn't done enough.
