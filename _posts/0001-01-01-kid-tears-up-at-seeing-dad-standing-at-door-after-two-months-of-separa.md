This kid had been struggling emotionally, with his dad being away in the Cayman Islands for work for two months. His parents planned to surprise him when his dad got off work early due to COVID 19. The father snuck inside the house and knocked on the kitchen door. The boy was not sure whom to expect, and when he saw his dad, he teared up and jumped in his arms to hug him tightly.  <br>*The underlying music rights are not available for license.
