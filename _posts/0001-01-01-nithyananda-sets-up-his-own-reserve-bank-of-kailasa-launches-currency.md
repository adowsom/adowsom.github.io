After announcing his own country called Kailasa last year, self-styled Godman and rape-accused Nithyananda has now come up with his own bank and currency. Calling it Reserve Bank of Kailasa, the absconding Godman said in a video that he is in talks with various countries where his 'Kailasa' currency will function. According to him, the Reserve Bank of Kailasa will function like the Vatican Bank which is located in Rome. He also claims that his bank, his currency and his economic policies are completely legal.   <br>The self-styled godman fled India after being accused of rape, kidnapping and torture.   <br>Nithyananda said that he will release further information about this on the occasion of Ganesh Chaturthi on August 22. Watch now to find out more.Â
