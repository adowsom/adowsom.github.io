Yeh Rishta Kya Kehlata Hai fame Hina Khan says she does not see the format and content of the medium changing because this is what the audience demands. At a time when the web space is booming with content driven projects, why are the audience still watching shows on the small screen that seem regressive? Hina, who essayed the title role in Naagin 5, feels the audiences does not like to watch shows on small screen that are a little progressive, Hina said, &quot;OTT platforms are there, and I am a fan of OTT platforms. I do watch a lot of shows on OTT platforms. I don't see the content changing in television. I don't really see that happening because people like what they watch and this is why we get ratings because they are happy. Is it regressive? Our show Naagin is completely different.&quot;
