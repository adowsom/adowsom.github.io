‘Bubble Gang’ returns tonight sans Michael V.  <br>If you haven’t been laughing as much lately it’s most likely because of two things: the pandemic of course and in effect, the country’s favorite gag show “Bubble Gang’s” forced hiatus from TV.  <br>But worry no more as the gang returns with brand new episodes on its usual time slot tonight on GMA Network and every Friday thereafter as usual. By the way, though, only the time slot remains “normal” at least for the rest of August; a lot of other things are done differently in the show amid this so called “new normal.”  <br>Video by: Kapuso PR   <br>Visit manilatimes.net for the full story:  <br>
