A Chinese vlogger on the mainland has given an update on how the country is coping with the ongoing pandemic.  <br>Filmed on August 15, YouTuber Billy explains what has been happening since the initial worry and panic of the Chinese population.  <br>Billy reveals that &quot;at this stage, COVID-19 is effectively contained&quot; in China and people are not inclined to wear a mask as they once were.  <br>The Chinese population are now no longer worried about COVID-19 and they are carrying on with their life, Billy says.  <br>Comparing present-day to five months ago, Billy cuts to a video he recorded of an argument over a mask that he explains wouldn't happen today.  <br>Billy adds that China is not out of the woods yet as there are still new cases but &quot;for the most part&quot; the virus is gone.  <br>In a message to countries still battling with coronavirus, he says: “I know it’s hard but we will overcome it.”
