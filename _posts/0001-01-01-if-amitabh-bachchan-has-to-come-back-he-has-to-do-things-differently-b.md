A film industry insider said that if Amitabh Bachchan wants to re-enter the industry then he should do something different. He should motivate and push small films which he took seriously. He is now playing blind as he has signed action director Veeru Devgan's directorial debut 'Hindustan Ki Kasam'. Big B now wants to tap untested talent.
