This is the hilariously odd moment a preacher in Apex, North Carolina is confronted with the incredibly raunchy lyrics of Cardi B and Meg Thee Stallion's smash-hit 'WAP' on August 25.  <br>The clip, going viral both on TikTok and Twitter, shows Flip Benham, an evangelical Christian minister and the leader Operation Save America, an anti-abortion group.  <br>Benham has had various run-ins with the police, and was convicted in 2011 for stalking a medical doctor.  <br>Hannah, the filmer, works for a local healthcare clinic, said she's been dealing with Benham's harassment daily.  <br>&quot;We face harassment from conservative pro-life groups including those led by Pastor Flip Benham, the man reading bible verses to our volunteers after we expressed we didn’t want to hear it. After trial and error, one of our defenders Alex (@alexthefeminist) started to recite “WAP” lyrics to him,&quot; Hannah told Newsflare in an exclusive interview.
