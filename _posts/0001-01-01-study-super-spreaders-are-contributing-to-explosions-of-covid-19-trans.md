A new study highlights the astonishing role played by 'super-spreaders' in the novel coronavirus COVID-19 pandemic.  <br>Super-spreading is a phenomenon in which certain individuals disproportionately infect a large number of people.  <br>Several super-spreader events have been recorded across the country since the start of the pandemic.  <br>According to UPI, roughly 20% of all COVID-19 infections in Georgia during the early stages of the outbreak were directly linked with 2% of the cases.  <br>The researchers say the findings indicate that super-spreading of the virus was widespread in the state, particularly in rural areas.  <br>Super-spreading can contribute to explosions of transmission, even when we are seeing the numbers of new cases declining.
