Kamala Harris launched a withering attack on Donald Trump’s leadership hours before he will accept his party’s re-nomination on Thursday, accusing the president of demonstrating a “reckless disregard” for the American people in his handling of the untamed coronavirus pandemic. Speaking from an auditorium at George Washington University, Harris, a California senator who last week became the first woman of color to accept the vice-presidential nomination of a major party, unfurled a wide-ranging offensive against Trump to address what she said was “a reality completely absent from this week’s Republican national convention”.“The Republican convention is designed for one purpose: to soothe Donald Trump’s ego, to make him feel good,” Harris said. “But here’s the thing: he’s the president of the United States, and it’s not supposed to be about him. It’s supposed to be about the health and the safety and the wellbeing of the American people.”“On that measure,” she continued, “Donald Trump has failed.”Harris, a former prosecutor, methodically detailed Trump’s response to the pandemic from his early praise of the Chinese government to his focus on the stock market.“Right at the moment we needed him to be tough on the Chinese government, he caved,” she said. “Instead of rising to meet the most difficult moment of his presidency, Donald Trump froze. He was scared, and he was petty and he was vindictive.”She continued: “He got it wrong from the beginning and then he got it wrong again and again and the consequences have been catastrophic.  <br>All data is taken from the source:   <br>Article Link:   <br>#harris #phillynews #fortmyersnews #news #nytimes #cnn #newsnow
