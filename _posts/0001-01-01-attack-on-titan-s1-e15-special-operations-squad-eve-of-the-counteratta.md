Everything in this life that’s worth a damn.&quot; -Eastman (The Walking Dead)  <br>&quot;I have spent my whole life scared, frightened of things that could happen, might happen, might not happen, 50-years I spent like that. Finding myself awake at three in the morning. But you know what? Ever since my diagnosis, I sleep just fine. What I came to realize is that fear, that’s the worst of it. That’s the real enemy. So, get up, get out in the real world and you kick that bastard as hard you can right in the teeth.&quot; -Walter White (Breaking Bad)  <br>Intro/Outro Song: Always Dreaming - Same Town Forever   <br>*This post may contain affiliate links.
