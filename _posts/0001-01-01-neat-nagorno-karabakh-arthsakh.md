The landlocked mountainous region of Nagorno-Karabakh is the subject of an unresolved dispute between Azerbaijan and Armenia. The territory is internationally considered to be part of Azerbaijan, but mostly governed by the Republic of Artsakh (formerly named Nagorno-Karabakh Republic), a de facto independent state with an Armenian ethnic majority.  <br>A ceasefire signed in 1994 provided for two decades of relative stability, which significantly deteriorated along with Azerbaijan's increasing frustration with the status quo, at odds with Armenia's efforts to cement it. A four-day ecalation in April 2016 became the deadliest ceasefire violation to date. Since then, the possibility of resumed major hostilities has greatly increased.  <br>So obvioulsy this is not a touristy area and travelling there is highly dicouraged by most organisations.  <br>Shooting locations:  Stepanakert, Sushi, Gandzsar Monastery, Askeran Fortress, Zontik waterfall, Zuar Hot Springs  <br>Facebook:   <br>Twitter:   <br>YouTube:   <br>Web:   <br>You can license raw footage clips from the Little Big World series here:   <br>WATCH FULL SCREEN!  <br>Shot with Lumix GH4 and GH5, 14-140mm and 7-14mm Lenses.
