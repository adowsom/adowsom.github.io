Thousands of anti-government protesters gathered in Bangkok, Thailand, today (Aug 16) for one of the largest rallies since 2014.  <br>Student activists were joined by left-wing 'red shirt' followers at the capital's Democracy Monument. There were also pro-establishment supporters who held a small counter-protest.  <br>Many people used umbrellas to shield themselves from the scorching midday sun. There were demands for 'democracy', with speakers continuing until 9pm when police arrived to peacefully disband the rally,  <br>The demonstration is the latest show of anger towards the country's military government which seized power following a coup in 2014. There have been a number of similar rallies in recent weeks, including a Harry Potter themed protest.  <br>Those involved, mainly students from universities, are calling for greater levels of democracy and accountability in the country, which Credit Suisse said in a report has the fourth most unequal levels of wealth in world.  <br>Thailand also ranks poorly in corruption ratings from international agencies.  <br>Controversial elections in March 2019 returned career soldier General Prayut Chan-o-cha to power and saw the progressive Future Forward Party disbanded, amid claims that opposition parties were being silenced.  <br>Protests have continued since the end of 2019 with mobs calling for the military government to be removed.  <br>A number of protest leaders have been arrested in recent months adding to the anger of protesters.
