Apple stock is at an all time high.  <br>The company recent hit the $2-trillion value.  <br>Daniel Ives of Wedbush thinks that Apple can gain more in the next 12 months.  <br>&quot;We still believe the stock has a lot of gasoline left in the tank with an iPhone 12 'supercycle' on the near term horizon,&quot; Ives wrote in a Friday note.  <br>Ives gave the stock an &quot;outperform&quot; rating.  <br>Business Insider says Ives gave the stock a price target of $515 and a bull case of $600, which is roughly 27% higher than where Apple closed Thursday.
