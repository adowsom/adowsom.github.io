The DNI will no longer provide the House and Senate Select Committees on Intelligence in-person briefings on election security issues.  <br>According to CNN, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence said it will provide written updates, instead.  <br>It's an abrupt change, running counter to the pledge of transparency and regular briefings on election threats by the intelligence community.  <br>Bill Evanina is the top official for election security in the DNI.  <br>Last month, he reiterated a commitment to providing briefings to Congress, along with the political parties and presidential campaigns.  <br>Earlier this month, Evanina released an unprecedented statement saying China &quot;prefers&quot; an outcome where President Donald Trump is not reelected in November and Russia is working to &quot;denigrate&quot; former Vice President Joe Biden's White House bid.
