The 13,500 page NIA chargesheet details how the Pulwama attack was planned by Pakistani handlers. Terror chats before the tragedy and in its aftermath reveal conversations on financing the attack, information exchanged on movement of Indian Air Force and how the attack video could be used for propaganda. The conversations which include 350 voice messages run into hours and are being used by the NIA to build its case against the Pakistan-based JeM which planned the attack.  <br>#PulwamaAttack #UmerFarooq #TerrorExport
