This husband greets his wife every morning with a coffee and cat cuddles.  <br>The clips, filmed over a week in July in Fort Worth, Texas show Tyler waking up his wife Emily every morning with a coffee and her cats so she can relax before work.  <br>Emily told Newsflare: &quot;Every day when he wakes up, my husband makes me coffee and grabs one of our two cats and brings them to me in bed.Â   <br>Tyler typically travels for work during the week, but due to the current state of the world, he has been home so he is able to do this for me every day. When he is traveling he still does this for me on the weekends.&quot;
