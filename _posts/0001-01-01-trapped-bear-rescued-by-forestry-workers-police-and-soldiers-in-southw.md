Local forestry workers rescued a brown bear that had been entangled in barbed wire near a forest in Sichuan, China. Police and soldiers from a Chinese People’s Liberation Army brigade in the southwestern province also took part in the rescue, which started after the soldiers happened to find the trapped wild carnivore.
