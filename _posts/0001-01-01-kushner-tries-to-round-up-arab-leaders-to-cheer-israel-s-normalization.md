CNN reports White House senior adviser Jared Kushner is traveling to the Middle East this weekend.  <br>He hopes to convince multiple Arab leaders to attend a splashy White House signing ceremony for the recent deal between the UAE and Israel.  <br>The aim is to celebrate a rare foreign-policy win and help bolster President Donald Trump's reelection efforts this November.  <br>The President's son-in-law also intends to pursue a series of normalization agreements between Israel and other Arab nations.  <br>Kushner's name and reputation have been inextricably linked to the flailing Middle East peace plan since the earliest days of the Trump administration.
