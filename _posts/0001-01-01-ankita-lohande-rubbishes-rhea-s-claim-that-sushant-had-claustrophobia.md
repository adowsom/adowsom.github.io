Ankita Lokhande, ex-girlfriend of Sushant Singh Rajput, has rubbished the claim of Rhea Chakraborty that the late actor had claustrophobia. Ankita's post comes as a slap on the claims made by the late actor's girlfriend Rhea Chakraborty who in an interview has reportedly said that Sushant had claustrophobia during their flight to Europe last year and took Modafinil in a bid to overcome the same.
