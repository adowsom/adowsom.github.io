Cheers!❤️  <br>#lion #bigcat #DocuEngsubChannel​  <br>✅       :  <br>***************************************  <br>From award-winning filmmakers and National Geographic Explorers-in-Residence Dereck and Beverly Joubert comes Game of Lions. According to Dereck Joubert, there are 20,000 lions left on Earth. Only 3,500 of those are males. We follow the journey of the lives of young males in the African bush and their potential to be king. From the birth of a male to his exile from his pride, our cameras follow along as males roam the jungles in an effort to spread their bloodlines through the kingdom.  <br>One out of eight lions survives into adulthood and the males that do enter into a game of kings, as each bloodline fights for its ultimate survival and right to win a pride. Each survivor is the result of hard battles won against hunger, attack by older males, and run-ins with different nomads all trying to win the ultimate prize: life.  <br>
