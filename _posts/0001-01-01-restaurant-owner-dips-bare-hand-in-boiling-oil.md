To the typical tourist, this small but popular eatery may simply seem completely typical of an overcrowded Indian city, however its owner has a very special talent: he regularly dips his hands into the boiling oil of his deep fry wok either to pluck out his restaurant's signature fried fish, or simply to impress his customers. Somehow he has discovered a way to block out of the pain caused by touching boiling hot oil over 170°C, or 340°F. Either that or the nerves in his hands have become seriously damaged and as a result he cannot feel pain in his hands. Regardless of the secret to his talent, he doesn't rely solely on this gimmick to attract the throngs of customers that come to his restaurant daily, as the rest of the items on the menu can easily compete with the finest non-vegetarian dishes the country can offer.
