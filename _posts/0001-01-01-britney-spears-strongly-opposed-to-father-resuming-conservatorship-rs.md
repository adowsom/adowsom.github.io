For more than a decade, Britney Spears has been subject to a conservatorship, where a judge appoints a guardian to manage the financial and personal affairs for someone who is incapacitated or incapable of making those decisions soundly on their own. According to a new court filing, the pop star says she sis &quot;strongly opposed&quot; to her father, James &quot;Jamie&quot; Spears, resuming his role as her conservator and overseer of her financial affairs and estate.
