Sonam Kapoor surprised her fans with a sneak peek into her luxurious Delhi home, where she was until recently quarantining with husband Anand Ahuja. Titled ‘Snapshots of Quarantine’, the Neerja actor posted a series of pictures that gave us a glimpse from the couple's gorgeous bedroom, to their kitchen, study, and even the shoe corner that showcased Anand Ahuja's wide sneaker collection. Situated in New Delhi's Golf Links neighbourhood, the residence, happens to be Anand Ahuja's childhood home.
