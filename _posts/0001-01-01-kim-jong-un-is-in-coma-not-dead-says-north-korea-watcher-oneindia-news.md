It is being reported that North Korean leader Kim Jong Un is in a coma and therefore his sister Kim-Yo Jong has taken over de facto control of the state since the Communist country cannot be without a leader for a prolonged period. This assessment was made by former aide of South Korea's late president Kim Dae-Jung.    <br>#KimJongUn #NorthKorea #KimDeadAlive
