DISCLAIMER: We're going to talk about the extensive document highlighting the reasons behind the decision to deduct Sheffield Wednesday 12 points and not punish them for the other EFL charges. No, wait! It'll be okay. We've done the hard reading so you don't have to. The Star's Owls writers Joe Crann and Alex Miller join Liam Hoden after pouring over what was a very insightful and at times eyebrow-raising document that could come to define the next few years at Hillsborough. They wade through the mud slinging and outrageous accusations and find sloppiness on both sides of the argument. But it's not all legal stuff - Wednesday are back in pre-season training and things are looking bright at Middlewood Road. The panel discuss the arrival of Chey Dunkley and what he will bring to the party, and they also look ahead to the season-opening fixture, the Carabao Cup clash with Walsall.
