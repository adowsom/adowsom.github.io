This person decided to root out the stump of a tree by tieing it to a chain with its other end tied to the back of a truck. They then drove the vehicle away from it, hoping to remove it from the ground. Unfortunately, the chain broke and hit the back of the truck in full force and ended up breaking a tail light and leaving several dents on its back.
