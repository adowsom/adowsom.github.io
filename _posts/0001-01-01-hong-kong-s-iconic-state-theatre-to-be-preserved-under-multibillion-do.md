The “essence” of Hong Kong's iconic State Theatre will be preserved as the site where it stands undergoes a multibillion-dollar redevelopment project. New World Development agreed to retain the 68-year-old theatre in North Point because of its historical value, and in turn won government approval to acquire pieces of property around the site that it had been trying to buy.
