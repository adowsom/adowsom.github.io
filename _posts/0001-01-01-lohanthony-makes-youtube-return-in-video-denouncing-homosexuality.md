Former YouTube star Lohanthony was known for his fun, flamboyant personality which gained him popularity online in videos about pop culture and social media drama. But after a hiatus from posting videos, he posted two this week proclaiming his newfound faith in Christianity and he seemingly denounced homosexuality as well as his past behavior as a gay man. Many fans believe he underwent conversion therapy.
