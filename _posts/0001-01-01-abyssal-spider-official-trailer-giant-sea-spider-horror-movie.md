Rescue member Ajie (played by Wang Yangming) and his companions rescued a reef tanker in the storm, but met the captain who was stubborn and unwilling to give up. At the same time, a dark shadow haunted the deep sea and dragged everyone into the sea. The surviving Ajie from then on, bearing the shadow of the death of colleagues, became decadent and disheartened.  <br>“Many years later, Ajie overcomes the shadow and boarded the fishing boat again, but he was constantly provoked by crew member Atai (played by Zheng Renshuo), deputy captain Ading (played by Li Liren) and others. One day, everyone rescued Xiaojing (played by Ke Jiaying) who had fallen into the sea due to the overturning of the yacht. Subtle changes occurred on the boat due to Xiaojing’s intrusion. Accidents began to spread frequently on the boat. Some people fell into the sea and died unexpectedly, and food and drinking water were destroyed. Because of the space pressure in the cabin and the lack of air and food, people began to clamor and panic, turning from mutual support to self-suspicion.  <br>“When the trapped people face the severe test of the storm, they find that the most dangerous thing is far more than this. There are unknown creatures under the water…The savage people must put aside their prejudices and work together to survive.”
