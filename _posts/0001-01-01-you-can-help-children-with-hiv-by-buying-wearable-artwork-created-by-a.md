Rommel Rico was a registered nurse in New York before he became an artist, and his gorgeous works are inspired by Filipino culture. Proceeds from Rommel's wearable art will go to the Duyan Program of Project Red Ribbon, an HIV and AIDS advocacy foundation. 'Being a nurse and a physical therapist malapit talaga ang puso ko to the children.'
