Pixar broke new ground when it created &quot;Toy Story&quot; in 1995, but from there it still had a long way to go to perfect 3D animated characters. Over the years, Pixar's animators would figure out everything from proper human movement to skin to hair. They figured out how to smooth out skin in &quot;Geri's Game.&quot; Then, when &quot;The Incredibles&quot; rolled around, they created new simulations to help control Mr. Incredible's muscle movements and Violet's long hair while also finding more accurate ways to light human skin. Violet's hair would later pave the way for long-haired characters like Colette in &quot;Ratatouille&quot; and the curly-haired heroine Merida of &quot;Brave.&quot; Meanwhile, Pixar's shading tools would allow the animators to add even more striking details to their human characters' faces, while innovative new methods of animating crowd scenes came about in &quot;Incredibles 2&quot; and &quot;Toy Story 4.&quot;
