Porsche completes its sports car trio: following on from the Coupé and Cabriolet, the third body variant of the new 911 generation now makes its debut with the all-wheel drive 911 Targa 4 and 911 Targa 4S models. The defining feature of the Targa remains its innovative, fully automatic roof system and,  as on the legendary original Targa from 1965, it consists of a wide Targa roll bar, a movable roof section over the front seats and a wraparound rear window. The roof can be conveniently opened and closed in just 19 seconds.  <br>It is powered by a six-cylinder, three-litre boxer engine with twin turbochargers: in the 911 Targa 4, it delivers 283 kW (385 PS) and, in combination with the optional Sport Chrono package, facilitates the 0-100 km/h sprint in 4.2 seconds – one tenth faster than before. In the 911 Targa 4S, it boasts 331 kW (450 PS), enabling the new model to reach the 100 km/h mark in just 3.6 seconds under the same conditions – four tenths faster than its predecessor. The top speed of the 911 Targa 4 is 289 km/h (up 2 km/h), while the 4S peaks at 304 km/h (up 3 km/h).
