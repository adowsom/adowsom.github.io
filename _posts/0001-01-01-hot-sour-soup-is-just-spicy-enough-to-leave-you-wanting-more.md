This Hot &amp; Sour Soup is an infinitely adaptable recipe that you can customize to your liking. If you'd prefer a version with pork, you can add ground or sliced meat at the very beginning of the cooking process, right after the aromatics and before the Sriracha. For a completely vegetarian version, use vegetable or mushroom broth instead of chicken broth.
