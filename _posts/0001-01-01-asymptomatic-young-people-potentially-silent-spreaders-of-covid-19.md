Asymptomatic young people could be &quot;silent spreaders of COVID-19.&quot;  <br>There are higher levels of the virus in their systems than hospitalized adults, a new study finds.  <br>In the study of 192 newborns to 22-year-olds, 49 tested positive for the virus, reports UPI.  <br>An additional 18 also had late-onset symptoms of the disease.  <br>Swabs revealed that infected children had significantly higher levels of the virus in their airways.  <br>That is when compared to hospitalized adults who were receiving treatment in the intensive care unit.  <br>This is the case even when those children have no outward symptoms of COVID-19.
