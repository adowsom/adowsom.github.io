A billboard calling for action in the killing of Breonna Taylor was vandalized.  <br>Red paint was put on her forehead in a small circle on the billboard in her hometown of Louisville, Kentucky.  <br>Oprah Winfrey's O Magazine put up 26 billboards around the city earlier this month.  <br>The billboards demanded that the Louisville police officers involved in her death be arrested and charged.  <br>Taylor, a 26-year-old EMT, was shot multiple times in March by police, says CNN.  <br>They were executing a no-knock warrant for a man but were at the wrong apartment.
