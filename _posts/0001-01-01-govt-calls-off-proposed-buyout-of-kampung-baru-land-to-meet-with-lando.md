The Federal Territories Ministry is arranging another meeting with owners and heirs of Kampung Baru land to present a new approach to the development of the area in the near future.  <br>Its Minister Tan Sri Annuar Musa said this followed the decision not to proceed with the Kampung Baru Development Concept Plan 2019 and the offer to purchase land at RM1,000 per square foot as it only obtained the consent of 61 percent of landowners there.  <br>Annuar said this on Friday, adding that his ministry has identified seven plots that can be developed immediately, and that the concept of development must also be participative with landowners with the involvement of government-linked companies (GLCs) as well as designating the site as a special development area.  <br>WATCH MORE:   <br>SUBSCRIBE:   <br>LIKE:
