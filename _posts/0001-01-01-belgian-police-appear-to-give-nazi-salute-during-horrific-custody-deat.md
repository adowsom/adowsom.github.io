A SLOVAKIAN businessman died in Belgian police custody while one officer appeared to make a Nazi salute while another laughed, shocking new footage has shown.  <br>Jozef Chovanec, 38, was arrested at Charleroi airport, outside Brussels, more than two years ago after causing a disturbance on his flight. The video, which was recorded on February 23 2018, showed the man first bang his head on the wall of his cell until his face was covered in blood, before being restrained by officers. He was eventually pinned to the ground by several policemen with on sitting on the 38-year-oldâ€™s chest for 18 minutes.  <br>One female officer was recorded making what appeared to be a Nazi salute while others laughed during the incident, the silent footage obtained by local newspaper Het Laatse Nieuws showed.  <br>Medical staff were seen using CPR on the man as his body appeared lifeless.  <br>Mr Chovanec was taken to hospital, but fell into a coma and died the next day, officially of a heart attack.  <br>His death has drawn parallels with the case of George Floyd, an American who died after a police officer kneeled on his neck on May 25.
