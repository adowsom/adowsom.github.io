If COVID-19 kills an additional 1 million White Americans, the numbers will match a grim stat.  <br>It would reduce their average life expectancy to levels seen by Black Americans.  <br>However, these number are seen by Black Americans during non-pandemic years, says UPI.  <br>&quot;Black Americans experience a scale of extra death every year that is more than the excess deaths that Whites are likely to experience from COVID-19,&quot; said Wrigley-Field, an assistant professor of sociology at the University of Minnesota.  <br>The Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences analysis reveals the scope of &quot;another U.S. catastrophe&quot;.  <br>It highlights the reality of the &quot;pandemic-scale problem&quot; of racial inequality, says UPI.
