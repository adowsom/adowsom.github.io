In this week’s ATSW, Peter Isler checks in from the ol’ family cabin on Skaneateles Lake to report that his Expedition weather routing successfully landed master mariner Stuart Rogerson in Ibiza, Spain, from Northern California, via the Panama Canal (after nine months). @Gary Jobson checks in on the World Sailing front, @ed baird on Florida storm life and the rise of wing sailing and remote-control racing. Plus…we have a stumper on the Name this One-Design. Check it.
