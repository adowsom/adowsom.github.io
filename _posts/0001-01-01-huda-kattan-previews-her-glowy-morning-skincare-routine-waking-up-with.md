If you’re reading this, it’s time to moisturize and Huda Kattan will show you how it’s done. The beauty mogul takes ELLE.com inside her morning routine, which begins with a stretch sequence before reaching for her skincare essentials. &quot;I feel like when I first started my business, and for the longest time, I spent all my life doing everything for everyone,&quot; Kattan admits from her fabulous new home. &quot;So I actually like to spend time doing things for myself now.&quot;  <br>Kattan walks us through her self-care start to the day, from a mini bar stocked with face rollers to a perfectly-organized beauty shelf.
