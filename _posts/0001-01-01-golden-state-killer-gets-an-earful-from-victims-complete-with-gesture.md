In a court summary released in Sacramento County Superior Court Monday, prosecutors said the scope of Joseph DeAngelo's crimes was 'simply staggering.'  <br>For a decade, DeAngelo carried out a reign of rape and murder in California that earned him the nickname 'Golden State Killer.'  <br>On Tuesday, victims described DeAngelo as a 'sick monster,' &quot;horrible man,' and 'subhuman' who stole their innocence and changed their lives.  <br>According to Newser, some read statements on behalf of their loved ones who could not testify in person.  <br>One adult daughter of a rape survivor gave DeAngelo the middle finger and cursed him.  <br>Between 1975 and 1986, DeAngelo committed 13 known murders and nearly 50 rapes. A former police officer, the 74-year-old eluded capture for decades.
