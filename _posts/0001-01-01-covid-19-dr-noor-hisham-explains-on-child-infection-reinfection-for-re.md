The condition of the 21 child patients who tested positive for Covid-19 from the Tawar cluster is under control even though children are more susceptible to infection, assured Tan Sri Dr Noor Hisham Abdullah.  <br>The Health director-general said this on Thursday when asked if child patientsâ€™ immune systems risked being compromised due to coronavirus, adding that none of the infected children in the Tawar cluster have been admitted into the intensive care unit (ICU) for treatment.  <br>Dr Noor Hisham also said studies have found that recovery from the Covid-19 virus did not guarantee immunity from it, adding that recovered patients can get reinfected again because they do not have the antibodies to fight the virus.  <br>WATCH MORE:   <br>SUBSCRIBE:   <br>LIKE:
