A Vietnamese man has spent the last 20 years decorating his house with over 10,000 porcelain bowls, plates, and ancient porcelain vases.  <br>Footage from August 25 showcases the walls, gates, bathrooms, and garden, all covered with porcelain.  <br>The owner of this unusual house is Nguyen Van Truong, a 58-year-old from Vinh Phuc Province, northeast Vietnam.    <br>He said: &quot;A lot of porcelain bowls and plates date from tens of years to hundreds of years and a few pieces date back to the 17th and 18th centuries.  <br>&quot;I want to preserve my country's culture. To make sure my legacy outlives my demise. I have already told my children that they cannot sell or demolish the house.&quot;  <br>Truong travels across Vietnam's northern provinces in search of traditional porcelain objects, acquiring as much as he can afford.
